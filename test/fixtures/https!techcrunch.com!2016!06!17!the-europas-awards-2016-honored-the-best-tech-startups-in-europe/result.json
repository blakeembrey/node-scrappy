      "articleBody": "This week The Europas Startup Conference and Awards -- the new type of tech event devised in partnership with TechCrunch and myself -- honored The Best Tech Startups in Europe. You can check out all the pictures here and follow the coverage on Twitter.\n\nAn annual celebration of Europe’s brightest and best tech companies, The Europas Conference and Awards for European Tech Startups has been an established fixture on the European scene since 2009, when it was first held in a London bar.\n\nMore than 50 stellar speakers presented in Central London, in a day of robust panels and small breakout workshops, just ahead of the industry Awards finale, where more than 27 of Europe's best startups and founders were honored by their peers.\n\nOver the last few weeks, startups had been able to either apply for an award or be nominated by a third-party. A judging panel then selected a shortlist of nominees, which was then submitted to public voting. The results were combined to determine the most forward-thinking and innovative European tech companies across 27 categories. No fees were paid by entrants or winners. The winners were announced on Tuesday, June 14, following The Europas daytime conference.\n\nIt’s been an incredible year for European startups, which have continued their exponential growth over the last few years. Europe right now couldn’t be better for startups. Every year we wonder if we are in a bubble. But the truth is we are in a 4th industrial revolution, and this is transforming our industry and society at large. We have come a long way from the first event in a bar in Bermondsey in 2009, but in front of almost 800 of Europe’s top tech entrepreneurs, The Europas Awards played host to the cream of Europe’s tech startup industry.\n\nTechCrunch is the exclusive media sponsor for The Europas, and all attendees, nominees and winners of the Europas Awards will get discounts to TechCrunch Disrupt in London later this year.\n\nSuranga Chandratillake, General Partner at Balderton Capital said: \"Once again the Europas brought together all the most interesting people in technology for an intense 24 hours of conversation, debate and the sharing of ideas. As public market multiples for software companies improve and deals like Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn happen, we appear to be on the cusp of a new dawn in the technology ecosystem and the conference's timing coincided perfectly with this more optimistic, yet reflective time.\"\n\nKatherine Crisp, Head of Strategy and Innovation at Unicef UK said: “We are thrilled to be part of the Europas and for a second year supporting the Best Humanitarian Tech Award. It was difficult to choose from the excellent shortlist, but we’re delighted that MeshPoint was chosen as the winner. MeshPoint was created in response to the refugee crisis. The team identified that the ability to communicate and access information was a critical need for families and children as they travelled across Europe. Their open source and durable Wi-Fi hotspot is a fantastic solution and we look forward to seeing how their technology can be utilized further to help families and children around the world.”\n\nChristian Hernandez Gallardo, Managing Partner, White Star Capital, commented: “From a small event in East London where a fledgling Swedish startup called Spotify won an award to the large event next to the Thames today, The Europas has become an iconic emblem of the acceleration of the digital ecosystem in Europe and a celebration of what we all are achieving.”\n\nJonathan Luff, co-founder, Epsilon Advisory Partners cautioned:\n“This is a critical moment for the UK's tech sector. There's so much at stake, and I really hope we don't put in jeopardy the prospects for UK tech and the fantastic startups here at The Europas with a reckless decision to leave the EU next week.”\n\nMelissa Jun Rowley, CEO of ‪TheToolbox.org‬, said: \"I moved to London for its thriving tech and social impact scene, and am so happy that The Europas organized a panel on the importance of humanitarian tech. It's a sign of what's to come. All tech has a humanitarian angle, you just need to bring the right players together. Mike and his team know how to do exactly that.\"\n\nAndy Hobsbawm, co-founder and CMO, EVRYTHNG, added: \"The Europas has created a platform for technology innovation and growth by connecting the best ideas, capital and entrepreneurs in Europe. As always, it's fantastic to be part of it.\"\n\nSarah Turner, founder of Angel Academe, summed it up: “No tokenism here. The most diverse tech event I've attended. Quality, fast-paced, useful.”\n\nDave Mathews, CEO NewAer, Inc. said: \"I've been coming to The Europas for the past five years from Silicon Valley and am impressed with the caliber and European diversity of the startups who debut and the executives who share their expertise on the stage.\"\n\nThose honored consisted of an amazing group of companies and people.\n\nThe winners, selected from the nominees, were:\n\n1 Best Media/Entertainment Startup\nThe Winner is: Dubsmash\nThe startup shows how amazing entertainment products can come out of Europe and go global.
