The other place was slightly bigger with a few chairs. The pearls at any BG is the BEST though! Best texture (firm and chewy) out of any PMT place. Sadly, I couldn't give it 5 stars because my matcha latte wasn't mixed at all (the sugar syrup was at the bottom) and the dirty horchata was so bitter. It didn't even taste like horchata anymore. I love their idea though with the organic milk and clean products. Definitely worth a try in SF! Go to the other one (approx. 1 mile away) if you can...I've also seen the co-founder/business owner at the other one and he was so nice!"

There was a good hint of cinnamon and I enjoyed it with a book at Dolores Park. Overall, it was good. Not as good as the Strawberry Matcha I had last time though. I would totally recommend that one."

            "description": "I was born and raised in southern california, which is riddled with boba places galore, so I got excited seeing a boba place while walking around the mission district. Usually, Small boba shop + long lines out the door = promising boba drinks. To be honest, I was a bit disappointed. The two main drinks I get at boba places are taro milk tea and almond milk tea. No taro here. This place has more unique drinks that traditional boba places don't have like horchata. They emphasize their use of loose leaf teas (which is great) rather than the powdered drinks. So I tried to be a little creative. I tried to create an almond milk tea drink by ordering the classic milk tea and substituted their default milk with almond milk and added the almond jelly. Drink felt a bit watered down and the almond jelly was lacking. I've made tastier, creamier almond jelly. It's a different kind of boba place. If you are looking for more traditional flavored boba drinks, don't go here. It's not the same."

I got the 16oz lychee green tea with milk and boba ($4.50). 50% sugar level seemed like the right call. It was super refreshing and different than what other boba places offer. You can tell everything is high quality. Highly recommend this place!"

This was the perfect level of creaminess and sweetness! Anyone who loves coconut milk will definitely enjoy this drink. The flavor is not artificial at all and their almond jelly is super smooth and not overwhelmingly flavored. Definitely want to come back and try all their other drinks!"

Both of them tasted watered down, not like milk teas but more like water. I was so disappointed because we stood in line for it. I'm not sure if choosing the almond milk made it taste watered down, but it really lacked flavor. I did however, like the almond jelly."

So, my favorite afternoon pick-me-up is tea from Boba Guys. I'm already obsessed with the Lychee Rose, which I'll have with or without soy milk and with little to no sugar. Of course, Boba Guys have great staples like standard milk tea, Hong Kong style milk tea, and matcha green tea. Tea has countless health benefits, and tastes great. One important note is that I love unsweetened bitter tea. It is super refreshing. If you've never had a milk tea, give it a try. It you are a regular, Boba Guys will give you high quality drinks at a reasonable price!"

I was told that their drinks were delicious, and that their boba was soft and chewy. These balls were supple, and released honey-like flavor while being mashed by your teeth. The concoctions are refreshing, with a little adventurous kick (Iced Strawberry Matcha Latte to Horchata to Lavender Black Milk tea etc). Way to incorporate various cultural flavors to create one perfect cup."

What I love about Boba Guys is that they managed to surprise me with delightful new flavor combos and other tasty treats, while also keeping the tapioca on point!the Boba: the texture of the boba is consistently very good, just the right amount of firmness and chewiness, not gummy or over-gelatinized like a bad take out restaurant that has boba sitting around for hours.Flavors: Enjoyed hot bergamot milk tea and on another occasion the HK milk tea with option to adjust sweetness level. Strawberry shortcake cotton candy: So good (like magic evaporating in your ) because it has that fresh strawberry flavor that reminded me of Japanese strawberry candy. I especially liked the little crumbles of cheesecake that melt in your mouth at the same rate of the cotton!! How do they do it??The real star of the night was a special with Kiefer and strawberry, it tasted like fresh strawberries in the summer, with a hint of that tart yogurt flavor and a smooth texture."

Had the Golden Honey Black Milk Tea with boba. My thoughts on the product here match what I said in my other review; the tapioca balls are definitely top notch and that you can tell that the good ingredients are in play. Downside of course is that the boba here is significantly more expensive than your regular boba shop and the line is usually out the freakin door.Boba Guys is good, but it's definitely not good enough to make me make a trek out of my way to come here."

I usually go for the more \"traditional\" teas like Jasmine and Earl Grey, but I love their Horchata and Lavender Black as well! I LOVE that they use real, loose-leaf teas. I also appreciate that they use real milk and even offer dairy-free options for the lactose intolerant who still want to enjoy milk tea. Their drinks taste freshly made and high quality. They are also one of the few places I've found that offer almond pudding (house made) as one of their toppings. If you enjoy almond pudding like I do, definitely give it a try with your drink here! I really love it in my Jasmine Milk Tea.If you're a milk tea connoisseur, this place is DEFINITELY worth checking out!"

This was my first time drinking boba in more than a year and I was a little disappointed.I got the DECAF BLACK (50% sugar) because I wanted something decaffeinated (my body doesn't tolerate caffeine well). At first I was going to pick the HORCHATA, which is the most popular decaf drink on the menu, but I could NOT adjust the sugar level on that one so I went with the decaf black tea, which the girl at the store \"recommended\". Not sure if she really knows the drinks all that well yet. The decaf black was VERY SWEET at 50%. It did not taste anything like a decaf black tea, but more like jasmine tea...I could not tell what was special about this drink or this boba place from drinking this tea. I think this is why there is only one picture of that drink on Yelp right now (which is mine lol).But then I tried my friend's rose tea and iced matcha latte and both were so much better than the stupid decaf black. I feel like I was rigged. The rose tea had a very aromatic, flora scent, while the ice matcha was just beautiful to look at. Anyways, if I liked boba more I would have loved this place. Just sucks that I don't drink caffeinated that often."

You can adjust sweetness level, ice level, and most importantly you can choose what kind of milk you want. You can choose between fresh milk, soy milk, and almond milk. Having soy milk and almond milk definitely helps take away my milk anxieties.As for toppings, they have boba, almond jelly and grass jelly I believe. I only tried the boba. It was super good, tasted like little gummies and super fresh. However, I did notice that they did harden a bit faster than other bobas, but if you drink your drink fast it shouldn't be a problem. Also they have strawberry matcha, as all you Yelpers can see, this item is not shown on the menu.. I wonder if there are any more \"secret\" items? :P"

The boba was soft and not overly chewy, which was awesome! 5/5 I approve.My friend got the basic Thai Tea and it was also good! Good balance of sweetness and tea. Yummmmmmmz.The line was not long at all. We went in and out in like 15 minutes with time to spare in the meter. It's a pretty small shop, but definitely worth the trip.

            "description": "I've been drooling over pictures that I had seen of Boba Guys milk tea before I had even tried it. Being from Seattle I dreamt of trying it and now that I live in the Bay those dreams came true. This place did not disappoint. The way they make their milk tea is an art. I got a classic milk tea and it was the best milk tea I've had. Not too sweet and also great tea flavor.If you haven't tried this place yet and you're dreaming about it like I was...don't worry...your dream will come true some day too. And it will totally live up to the hype."

Tasted kind of weird to me, but he liked it lolHong Kong style milk tea - Hubby liked it. I did not. It was too bitter for my liking. :( Maybe extraaaaa condensed milk would be good lolWe also tried the cotton candy (Sugar and Spun), which we enjoyed!Strawberry shortcake and peanut butter & jelly. 4/5!+ Almond, soy, and organic milk options+ Sweetness levels+ Friendly & quick service. They were really patient w us!"
