What I love about Boba Guys is that they managed to surprise me with delightful new flavor combos and other tasty treats, while also keeping the tapioca on point!the Boba: the texture of the boba is consistently very good, just the right amount of firmness and chewiness, not gummy or over-gelatinized like a bad take out restaurant that has boba sitting around for hours.Flavors: Enjoyed hot bergamot milk tea and on another occasion the HK milk tea with option to adjust sweetness level. Strawberry shortcake cotton candy: So good (like magic evaporating in your ) because it has that fresh strawberry flavor that reminded me of Japanese strawberry candy. I especially liked the little crumbles of cheesecake that melt in your mouth at the same rate of the cotton!! How do they do it??The real star of the night was a special with Kiefer and strawberry, it tasted like fresh strawberries in the summer, with a hint of that tart yogurt flavor and a smooth texture."

I usually go for the more \"traditional\" teas like Jasmine and Earl Grey, but I love their Horchata and Lavender Black as well! I LOVE that they use real, loose-leaf teas. I also appreciate that they use real milk and even offer dairy-free options for the lactose intolerant who still want to enjoy milk tea. Their drinks taste freshly made and high quality. They are also one of the few places I've found that offer almond pudding (house made) as one of their toppings. If you enjoy almond pudding like I do, definitely give it a try with your drink here! I really love it in my Jasmine Milk Tea.If you're a milk tea connoisseur, this place is DEFINITELY worth checking out!"

Both of them tasted watered down, not like milk teas but more like water. I was so disappointed because we stood in line for it. I'm not sure if choosing the almond milk made it taste watered down, but it really lacked flavor. I did however, like the almond jelly."

This was the perfect level of creaminess and sweetness! Anyone who loves coconut milk will definitely enjoy this drink. The flavor is not artificial at all and their almond jelly is super smooth and not overwhelmingly flavored. Definitely want to come back and try all their other drinks!"

So, my favorite afternoon pick-me-up is tea from Boba Guys. I'm already obsessed with the Lychee Rose, which I'll have with or without soy milk and with little to no sugar. Of course, Boba Guys have great staples like standard milk tea, Hong Kong style milk tea, and matcha green tea. Tea has countless health benefits, and tastes great. One important note is that I love unsweetened bitter tea. It is super refreshing. If you've never had a milk tea, give it a try. It you are a regular, Boba Guys will give you high quality drinks at a reasonable price!"

I was told that their drinks were delicious, and that their boba was soft and chewy. These balls were supple, and released honey-like flavor while being mashed by your teeth. The concoctions are refreshing, with a little adventurous kick (Iced Strawberry Matcha Latte to Horchata to Lavender Black Milk tea etc). Way to incorporate various cultural flavors to create one perfect cup."

Had the Golden Honey Black Milk Tea with boba. My thoughts on the product here match what I said in my other review; the tapioca balls are definitely top notch and that you can tell that the good ingredients are in play. Downside of course is that the boba here is significantly more expensive than your regular boba shop and the line is usually out the freakin door.Boba Guys is good, but it's definitely not good enough to make me make a trek out of my way to come here."

This was my first time drinking boba in more than a year and I was a little disappointed.I got the DECAF BLACK (50% sugar) because I wanted something decaffeinated (my body doesn't tolerate caffeine well). At first I was going to pick the HORCHATA, which is the most popular decaf drink on the menu, but I could NOT adjust the sugar level on that one so I went with the decaf black tea, which the girl at the store \"recommended\". Not sure if she really knows the drinks all that well yet. The decaf black was VERY SWEET at 50%. It did not taste anything like a decaf black tea, but more like jasmine tea...I could not tell what was special about this drink or this boba place from drinking this tea. I think this is why there is only one picture of that drink on Yelp right now (which is mine lol).But then I tried my friend's rose tea and iced matcha latte and both were so much better than the stupid decaf black. I feel like I was rigged. The rose tea had a very aromatic, flora scent, while the ice matcha was just beautiful to look at. Anyways, if I liked boba more I would have loved this place. Just sucks that I don't drink caffeinated that often."

The boba is not honey boba and has no sweetness at all. The grass jelly is also tough and flavorless, not quite sure why it's much firmer than any I've ever had before.

You can adjust sweetness level, ice level, and most importantly you can choose what kind of milk you want. You can choose between fresh milk, soy milk, and almond milk. Having soy milk and almond milk definitely helps take away my milk anxieties.As for toppings, they have boba, almond jelly and grass jelly I believe. I only tried the boba. It was super good, tasted like little gummies and super fresh. However, I did notice that they did harden a bit faster than other bobas, but if you drink your drink fast it shouldn't be a problem. Also they have strawberry matcha, as all you Yelpers can see, this item is not shown on the menu.. I wonder if there are any more \"secret\" items? :P"

Let me tell you, it was definitely worth the hype. I got the Horchata and it was so good! I love Horchata and this one hit the spot. The boba was soft and not overly chewy, which was awesome! 5/5 I approve.My friend got the basic Thai Tea and it was also good! Good balance of sweetness and tea. Yummmmmmmz.The line was not long at all. We went in and out in like 15 minutes with time to spare in the meter. It's a pretty small shop, but definitely worth the trip.

Prices are also comparatively higher, but you can tell that the boba and tea ingredients are quality, so perhaps the prices are justified. I got a 16oz Golden Black Tea with almond jelly, 25% sweet. I personally like my milk tea to have a stronger tea flavor, and Boba Guys lived up to expectations with a fragrant, fresh flavor that was not overwhelmed by the milk. The almond jelly had a nice, subtle sweetness, but the texture was a little harder than I expected. It was a lightly sweet and refreshing drink for a warm, sunny day in the park. Overall my drink ended much quicker than I would have liked; should've paid the extra $1 and sized up!"

            "description": "My new favorite boba spot. I honestly don't know why it took me so long to finally try it out but it's AMAZING. The Matcha Latte is on point, sorry to all my other matcha latte's perhaps I'll take you back another day. I love how they use local and more natural ingredients. Some of their toppings are made in house which is so cool to me. I haven't been to another place that does something like that. Im very picky about the way I like my tea and the Hong Kong style tea was on point. It def had the authentic tea tones and flavor I always look for. The boba is definitely Grade A all the way, just like their service! The person that helped us was super friendly. I will be coming back real soon to get more Grade A boba!!"

            "description": "I've come to this location and the one in Chinatown a few times and I gotta say, it's not really worth the hype for me. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.Is Boba Guys delicious? Yes. Are their drinks of higher quality? Yes. Is the actual business pleasant to be in? Sure, as far as a grab-n-go concept like boba are concerned. The branding is pretty cute, with that cheeky little aardvark just doin' his thang in the center of the logo. So why the 3 stars?Something about Boba Guys just doesn't do it for me. I feel like part of my issue is that my drink is gone in three sips...maybe instead of the 16oz size I should be ordering the 20oz? But I also feel like a lot of a 16oz from Boba Guys is mostly ice...Had the Muscat oolong tea with light sweetness, almond milk, and boba today. I liked the flavor of the oolong with the almond milk and the boba had great chewiness and a slight sweetness, which is a great combo. Recently, I had my first oolong milk tea at Little Sweet in the Richmond and while it was a completely different variety than the one served at BG, it set the bar pretty high. This drink, as well as all the other drinks I've gotten from here, are good. But they're a little steep in price for what you end up with, which is delicious, and gone instantly. You want to be able to justify spending $5 on tasty boba but when the experience is so short-lived, and there are sooo many other boba places to try, I feel like it's okay to try this place at least once, just to check it off the list.I will be back, at some point, but eagerly await exploring the other boba options in the bay."
