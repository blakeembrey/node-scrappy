        "description": "The Boosted Dual+ is temporarily out of stock. Please check back soon for availability. Mindblowing Power, Speed, and Braking. The Dual+ is a technological marvel, cleverly disguised as an everyday longboard. With custom controlled speed and power settings, take it easy while learning and then graduate to supercar performance. With faster acceleration, a higher top speed, and stronger braking, it's the board for people who always wish they were going faster. Includes: Boosted Dual+ Drive 2,000 Watt Electric Longboard Bluetooth Remote Control 60 Minute Fast Charger User Manual Specifications Performance Specs Max Speed - 22 mph Get to your destination fast. Zip past bikers on your morning commute and arrive with plenty of time to grab a coffee. The Dual+ Drive is our fastest most powerful board. Range - 7 Miles Expect 7 miles of range under normal riding conditions while in eco mode. In expert mode you can expect 6 miles of range. Riding slowly increases range, while hills and rough pavement decrease range. Regenerative brakes help you recoup energy riding down hills or coming to a stop. You can easily kick push the board if you do run out of battery, so you'll never be stranded. The Dual+ has an additional mode that unlocks the full potential of the board's power and acceleration; in this mode the range will be reduced to 4.5 miles. Power - 2,000 Watts Race up hills with amazing torque. Elite Tour de France riders generate 500W riding up the mountains. You've got up to 4x that available on demand. Uphill Climbing - 25% Grade Never walk up those steep hills or break a sweat again. You'll speed up unbelievably steep hills faster than even the most fully spandexed bikers. Powerful Regenerative Braking Brake with confidence using Boosted's powerful regenerative braking system. Both driven wheels help slow you down so you can stop confidently even while turning or going down a hill. Highly efficient regeneration is active whenever you pull the brakes helping you recoup energy riding down hills or coming to a stop. Product Specs Weight - 15 lbs The board is light enough so you can easily carry it up stairs, in a restaurant or into any workplace. You can stow the board under your desk or lean it up against any wall - safe from people bumping into it. Deck Length - 38 Inches At the lower end of a typical longboard length, the board allows for great cruising on streets and sidewalks as well as the ability to easily stow in tight places. Truck Width - 10 Inches Genuine Caliber trucks match the Loaded Vanguard Deck geometry beautifully, giving you optimal wheel-to-deck clearance for clean carving. You'll feel sure and stable with the extra wide wheelbase from these 10\" class longboarding trucks. Wheel Size - 75mm The Orangatang In Heat wheels are perfect for hard turns, provide excellent traction and can easily handle manholes or cracks on the road. In The Box Boosted Dual+ Electric Longboard Twin Brushless DC-Motors - 2,000 Watts Of Power Boosted's Dual drive plus provides rocket powered acceleration even on the steepest hills. Expect a smooth and balanced ride with unparralled power and torque. Stop on a dime with the additional power and torque accessible for braking. Our low profile, inner mount design protects the motors and keeps the ride height low to maximize your longboarding experience. Lithium Iron Phosphate 99W-Hour Battery Boosted's top tier automotive grade battery cells mean you get the perfect balance of portability, safety, power, and range. The cells are rated for 2,000+ full charge cycles, so you can expect the battery to last. Our fully custom state of the art Battery Management System (BMS) electronics protect your battery while providing accurate charge measurements. Loaded 38 Inch Flexible Bamboo Vanguard Deck The team at Loaded makes some of the best longboarding decks in existence. With its fiberglass-reinforced bamboo laminate construction, the Vanguard is no exception. You'll barely notice the bumps when you're carving hard on this nimble and flexible deck. Orangatang In Heat Wheels Don't reinvent the wheel. Orangatang's 75mm In Heat wheels are large enough to tackle the cracks and gravel the real world throws in your way. They've been designed for high speeds, excellent traction, and an overall smooth ride. You'll be carving hard with confidence on these hot orange kicks. Caliber Trucks Choosing the right truck was all about performance. We asked longboarding pros what truck they preferred and they said Caliber for their clean ride and bulletproof design. We haven't been disappointed. Remote Control Intuitive, proportional, and responsive, the fully custom Boosted remote gives you direct control over your ride. Accelerate or brake with an ergonomic thumbwheel while an LED display interface on the remote tells you how much range is left on the board. You'll find it simple to command the board to go as fast or as slow as you like or even go in reverse. An extra powerful Bluetooth LE wireless unit makes a solid link between the remote and the board. 60 Minute Charger Get rolling quickly with our standard 60 minute fast charger. Compact and easy to carry, the charger is similar in size and shape to a laptop charger. In a hurry? Plug in for just 30 minutes to get 85% of your charge.
