Now I will say I am partially biased because everything I have is on the Apple ecosystem, but even without other apple products, I would still get it. Very easy to use, great looking screen and has all the apps I could ever want. Highly pleased!",

One day while I was playing angry birds my daughter snatched the iPhone from me and called for pizza. Woah! First, I had no clue that the iPhone was also a phone- I don't know how they do that without any wires. But, that's okay i guess because I like pizza. Anyhow, I wish my parents had an app so I could call them too. Why doesn't everyone have apps? Wish I could only rate 4.5 stars because of that.",
