There is so much hype about this place and the very first time I came here, we waited around 45 minutes, but it was well worth it! The place inside is small, with just a window bar and a few seats, making the waiting area inside a bit cramped, yet the people working and the cashiers are always so friendly and help to move the line and wait time as quickly as possible. When it came time to order, the cashier even offered her suggestions on the level of sweetness and different boba combinations to better personalize my drink, which I enjoyed.My favorites to get here are the Horchata and the Thai Tea! Not cloyingly sweet, and the large size comes with an even affordable price.Overall, if you're ever on Valencia and are headed to Dolores Park, stop by here and check it out, and hope the line isn't too far out the door because it's seriously that good!"

            "description": "Finally came to this place after wanting to try it due to all the hype. I got the HK milk tea tapioca. They charge you extra for tapioca, which is nickel and diming customers in my opinion. My drink was over $5. The \"default\" sweetness level is 100% but I choise 75%. Boy, I was glad I chose 75% because for the first time in my boba-drinking life, I had to add water the dilute the drink because it was so painfully sweet. I feel bad for whoever orders the 100% \"default\" sweetness because that would be like drinking straight honey. Next time, if I do go back, I will order 50% sweetness. IMO, Purple Kow in the Richmond district still beats this. Maybe the financial district location is better so I will give this place on more shot before I decide. Parking was a bitch, I spent like 30 minutes trying to find one. The clerk was hot though."

Growing up in the Bay Area I've tried a lot of different boba places in my life but Boba Guys by far tops most other places I've been to. Ordered the rose black tea and horchata boba with pearls. The rose black tea was good but would have tasted better if I'd chosen a higher level of sweetness (75% instead of 50%). By itself the black tea would only garner 3.5 stars but oh my gosh the horchata boba (100% sweetness) was heavenly. It was THAT good. The cinnamon flavor was on point and the boba was soft and chewy. Who would have thought that horchata would go so well with boba??Overall definitely worth the wait. Also the interior is beautifully minimalistic. Will be back for sure!"

We ordered:-1 16 oz. iced Jasmine Milk Tea without toppings, organic milk, 25% sugar // Asked for no ice, still got ice. Jasmine tea flavor is super faint- overpowered by milk (at least 2/3 of the cup was milk instead). Also, organic milk tasted more like soymilk since it wasn't rich or creamy at all....a 1/5 drink.-1 16 oz. iced HK Style Milk Tea with pearls, organic milk, 50% sugar // Condensed milk overkill- can't imagine what it would be if it was 100% sweetness! There was barely any boba and the boba was too stiff- not soft at all. It says \"blended with condensed milk\"...felt like I was eating straight out of the jar myself.Pros:+Fast service. Waited in line for 20 minutes, ordered in 1 minute, got the drink in 2 minutes. +Cute concept. Cute ant-eater, crisp interior. Good selection of basics on the menu!Cons:-Meh service. Lady looked piss the whole time...good thing I didn't tip. -Pricey. $8 for two drinks? I would rather spend my $8 on a cream tart at Tartine's. Tips/Observations:-Why don't they have a stamp card system? Not that I would want one..but I'm sure there are die-hard fans here. -Small space. Definitely grab and go unless you manage to steal a spot by the window. -What is their signature drink here? Overall, not impressed. They can't even get the basic teas right....not even sure what more to expect.Nice try, Boba Guys. May attempt to get it again at a different location...and try their swirly pink drink."

            "description": "We wanted boba/PMT while in the SF area, and we had all heard of Boba Guys before so we thought to give it a try. Luckily, there wasn't much of a line when we entered, though one formed as soon as we got our drinks. The store is pretty small so don't be too daunted by the line going out the store!The interior was clean and modern. We had a hard time deciding which drinks to get because we had heard so much about which ones were good! To be able to get a taste of what they were, I decided to get their classic milk tea. It ended up tasting sort of...bland. The tea could definitely be brewed stronger as I could hardly taste it. The pearls did not live up to standard. Some of them were hard and even the chewier ones had hard centers. Did not live up to the hype!! My friend's muscat oolong was the same way, and way too sweet for me at 75%.The person taking my order was nice and made sure that I would get what I wanted. My drink also came out super fast. The store was marketing itself as having high class, special blend teas when I could hardly even taste it. It felt like it was hopping on the boba trend and trying to turn it hip and trendy whilst not paying attention to their drinks. I would come back maybe one more time if I find myself in the area to try their matcha latte, but it's not worth a trip especially with so many other places closer to South Bay."

The drink itself did not taste like lychee at all, was bitter, and had an odd aftertaste. The pearls, which I had heard were heavenly, tasted normal. Also tried the jasmine milk tea here and it was pretty good, but still nothing special to rave about. Small but cute aesthetic interior & really good service but the drinks itself were subpar. Maybe next time I'll come back to try the iced matcha latte since I've heard good reviews about that."

The other place was slightly bigger with a few chairs. The pearls at any BG is the BEST though! Best texture (firm and chewy) out of any PMT place. Sadly, I couldn't give it 5 stars because my matcha latte wasn't mixed at all (the sugar syrup was at the bottom) and the dirty horchata was so bitter. It didn't even taste like horchata anymore. I love their idea though with the organic milk and clean products. Definitely worth a try in SF! Go to the other one (approx. 1 mile away) if you can...I've also seen the co-founder/business owner at the other one and he was so nice!"

So, my favorite afternoon pick-me-up is tea from Boba Guys. I'm already obsessed with the Lychee Rose, which I'll have with or without soy milk and with little to no sugar. Of course, Boba Guys have great staples like standard milk tea, Hong Kong style milk tea, and matcha green tea. Tea has countless health benefits, and tastes great. One important note is that I love unsweetened bitter tea. It is super refreshing. If you've never had a milk tea, give it a try. It you are a regular, Boba Guys will give you high quality drinks at a reasonable price!"

I think that living in Taiwan has made me hypercritical of boba in the US. That said, I can still appreciate boba here. With all the hype around Boba Guys, I was very skeptical. Now that I've been, I can say that I was unimpressed. - Jasmine milk tea with boba- Horchata with boba- Muscat oolong milk tea with bobaI went with three friends: all of us of Taiwanese decent, all of us have lived in Taiwan. We all felt the tea was very bland and the boba itself too sweet. My jasmine milk tea felt very watered down. I couldn't really taste the tea. I know people might say it tastes watered down because they use milk instead of creamer, but that shouldn't affect the tea strength, just the creaminess. I had adjusted mine to be no ice and 25% sugar, too. My other friends also felt the teas were watered down and the drinks too sweet. My friend complained about the cups. The lids are a little annoying and pop off if you squeeze the cup. Also, the tea kind if goes everywhere when you try putting the straw in. I feel like Boba Guys is targeted at a very specific group of people: the trendy, hip crowd. Boba isn't meant to be fancy and describing it as \"heirloom tea with organic milk\" only adds to the annoyingness of Boba Guys. But that's just me. I mean, boba wasn't created to be some healthy, pretentious drink, but that seems to be how they're trying to market it here. Anyways, boba goodness might be subjective. As long as you're not looking for a CoCo or 50嵐, you can try Boba Guys and decide for yourselves. Personally, I won't be back. There is better boba in the city."

You have the option of choosing a topping, type of milk, and sweetness. 50% sweetness was enough to taste the jasmine flavor with a kick of sugar. I have to be honest, the milk tea looked equivalent to murky swamp water. It looked displeasing at first, but after the first sip, it tasted just all right. I think all the hype is mainly about their so-called \"grade-A balls.\" The consistency was sweet and chewy, aka any typical description of tapioca balls. Maybe it's the location, but the standards of this boba guys is mediocre."

This was the perfect level of creaminess and sweetness! Anyone who loves coconut milk will definitely enjoy this drink. The flavor is not artificial at all and their almond jelly is super smooth and not overwhelmingly flavored. Definitely want to come back and try all their other drinks!"

I was told that their drinks were delicious, and that their boba was soft and chewy. These balls were supple, and released honey-like flavor while being mashed by your teeth. The concoctions are refreshing, with a little adventurous kick (Iced Strawberry Matcha Latte to Horchata to Lavender Black Milk tea etc). Way to incorporate various cultural flavors to create one perfect cup."

The organic milk and almond milk are to die for, but I'm personally I just stick to the almond milk. My personal favorite drink is Iced Matcha with almond milk and no sweetener. I just love how earthy their match is. Thai Tea is also a favorite, Jasmine, and Honey Black Tea. Also if you're brave enough, try the charcoal pineapple cake!

Bad things may include things like laughing at funerals, not telling your friends when they have stuff stuck in their teeth and never changing the batteries in the remote control and waiting for someone else to do it because you're too lazy. Drinking Boba guys before a volleyball game is in the middle. I'm really spoiled. I'm from southern California, my entire family is from Hong Kong/Malaysia and having spent lots of summers in Hong Kong/Singapore, the best boba is back there. Their boba is good-- probably really good, but it's a little pricey for just boba and probably not the best before a volleyball game (milk was a bad choice). A small part of me dies when I'm submitted to expensive boba, so I took off a star. And I reaffirmed my decision in taking off a star when I remembered how long the line was."

            "description": "Such a let down...I ordered the Earl grey and the coconut green tea with almond milk and almond jelly. Our drinks came out looking a little light. Both of them tasted watered down, not like milk teas but more like water. I was so disappointed because we stood in line for it. I'm not sure if choosing the almond milk made it taste watered down, but it really lacked flavor. I did however, like the almond jelly."

            "description": "My favorite boba place in SF! I love the chewiness of the boba and interesting flavors offered here. I got the 16oz lychee green tea with milk and boba ($4.50). 50% sugar level seemed like the right call. It was super refreshing and different than what other boba places offer. You can tell everything is high quality. Highly recommend this place!"

            "description": "Having been to the Union Square location, my friends and I happened to be close enough in the area to the Mission location to make a trek there. Had the Golden Honey Black Milk Tea with boba. My thoughts on the product here match what I said in my other review; the tapioca balls are definitely top notch and that you can tell that the good ingredients are in play. Downside of course is that the boba here is significantly more expensive than your regular boba shop and the line is usually out the freakin door.Boba Guys is good, but it's definitely not good enough to make me make a trek out of my way to come here."

            "description": "SO SWEET. Please have more less-sweet decaf drink options!!! This was my first time drinking boba in more than a year and I was a little disappointed.I got the DECAF BLACK (50% sugar) because I wanted something decaffeinated (my body doesn't tolerate caffeine well). At first I was going to pick the HORCHATA, which is the most popular decaf drink on the menu, but I could NOT adjust the sugar level on that one so I went with the decaf black tea, which the girl at the store \"recommended\". Not sure if she really knows the drinks all that well yet. The decaf black was VERY SWEET at 50%. It did not taste anything like a decaf black tea, but more like jasmine tea...I could not tell what was special about this drink or this boba place from drinking this tea. I think this is why there is only one picture of that drink on Yelp right now (which is mine lol).But then I tried my friend's rose tea and iced matcha latte and both were so much better than the stupid decaf black. I feel like I was rigged. The rose tea had a very aromatic, flora scent, while the ice matcha was just beautiful to look at. Anyways, if I liked boba more I would have loved this place. Just sucks that I don't drink caffeinated that often."

            "description": "I happened to run into this Boba Guys location on the way to Dolores Park and had to grab a drink. This time I tried a simple classic: Jasmine Milk Tea with boba. You can usually tell if a milk tea place is good if their jasmine milk tea is good... and this place is good. I'm still a bigger fan of Ashas (has an SF and Berkeley location) but Boba Guys is always a great idea if you're in the neighborhood. I had a sip of my friend's coffee milk tea. I thought it tasted good, but wouldn't choose that drink here. There's much more interesting and better tasting drinks. If you want something super Instagrammable and yummy, I highly suggest the matcha latte with strawberry and boba."
