restrictions would stop short of placing a full travel ban on the country of 200 million, but will suspend U.S. immigrant visas for Nigeria, along with Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar.<\/p>\n<p>That applies to citizens from those countries looking to live permanently in the U.S. The latest restrictions are said not to apply to non-immigrant, temporary visas for tourist, business, and medical visits.<\/p>\n<p>Tanzania and Sudan also face new restrictions. Both countries were suspended from <a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/us-visas\/immigrate\/diversity-visa-program-entry.html\">U.S. diversity visa program<\/a>, also known as the green card lottery.<\/p>\n<p>The news was first reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/cc950f2201d17f6e49311ae1909ebb1c\">the Associated Press<\/a>, after a briefing by Acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. The Department of Homeland Security later provided TechCrunch with Wolf&#8217;s remarks and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dhs.gov\/news\/2020\/01\/31\/raising-global-travel-security-bar-dhs-announces-new-travel-restrictions-six\">summary<\/a> on the measures.<\/p>\n<p>The primary reason for the new restrictions, according to DHS, was that the countries did not &#8220;meet the Department&#8217;s stronger security standards.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Secretary Wolf noted, &#8220;the restrictions are not permanent if the country commits to change.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The move follows<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/27\/trumps-travel-ban-could-extend-to-africas-top-tech-country-nigeria\/\"> reporting over the last week<\/a> that the Trump administration was considering adding Nigeria, and several additional African states, to the list of predominantly Muslim countries on its 2017 travel ban. That ban was delayed in the courts until being upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>Nigeria&#8217;s population is roughly 45% Muslim and the country has faced problems with terrorism, largely related to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2014\/06\/09\/world\/boko-haram-fast-facts\/index.html\">Boko Haram<\/a> in its northeastern territory.<\/p>\n<p>Restricting immigration to the U.S. from Nigeria, in particular, could impact commercial tech relations between the two countries.<\/p>\n<p>Nigeria is the U.S.\u2019s second largest African trading partner and the U.S. is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, according to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ustr.gov\/countries-regions\/africa\/nigeria\">USTR<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.state.gov\/u-s-relations-with-nigeria\/\">State Department<\/a>\u00a0briefs.<\/p>\n<p>Increasingly, the nature of the business relationship between the two countries is shifting to tech.

proposed orbital tasks like reconfiguring or repairing a satellite or manufacturing new components from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing the Restore-L spacecraft will do is show that it can synchronize with, capture, connect with and refuel a satellite in orbit, then release it into a new orbit. Afterwards the craft will use the Maxar-built robotic arm to assemble a multi-panel antenna reflector, then test it.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1940590\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/maxar-spider.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"499\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Last, a separate piece of hardware, Tethers Unlimited&#8217;s MakerSat, will extrude a beam some 10-20 meters long, which will be inspected by the parent satellite, then detached and reattached to demonstrate its robustness.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are continuing America\u2019s global leadership in space technology by proving we can assemble spacecraft with larger and more powerful components, after launch,&#8221; said NASA&#8217;s Jim Reuter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/press-release\/nasa-funds-demonstration-of-assembly-and-manufacturing-in-space\">in a news post<\/a>. &#8220;This technology demonstration will open up a new world of in-space robotic capabilities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no hard timeline for the mission yet, but it&#8217;s intended to take off the mid 2020s. This isn&#8217;t a small-scale experiment that can fly up next week in an Electron \u2014 it&#8217;s a big, expensive one that will likely take up most of a large rocket&#8217;s payload.<\/p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s only a demonstration, a Maxar representative pointed out that it is very close to what would be an operational system on other satellites in the future. It has also been previously demoed on the ground, though of course that&#8217;s no substitute for the real thing.<\/p>\n<p>Robotic arms are something of a specialty for Maxar, which has delivered six total for NASA, including the one on Insight (currently on the Red Planet) and the Mars 2020 Rover (due to receive its official, inspirational name any day now).<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll have Maxar&#8217;s head of space robotics<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/06\/maxars-space-robotics-head-lucy-condakchian-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-roboticsai\/\"> onstage at TC Sessions: Robotics + AI<\/a> in March at UC Berkeley, so be sure to join us there if you&#8217;d like to hear more about the business of building space robots.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SPIDER will be integrated with the spacecraft bus Maxar is building for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NASA<\/a> Restore-L project, which will refuel a satellite in low Earth orbit.

CAA, Michael Yanover is still betting startups can change Hollywood&#8217;s agencies"},"content":{"rendered":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">In a large<\/span> office scattered with drums, family mementos, and a well-used whiteboard, on the second floor of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.caa.com\/\">Creatlve Artist Agency<\/a>&#8216;s Los Angeles glass, steel, and marble headquarters, Michael Yanover is busy plotting which CAA-repped talent could be the next big entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Over a sixteen year career at one of Hollywood&#8217;s biggest agencies, Yanover has developed various strategies to align Silicon Valley&#8217;s tech industry with the star-making machine in Hollywood.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">It&#8217;s a bid to keep agencies relevant (and profitable) in a world where technological innovation continually resets the fifteen minute clock on the famous, the almost famous, and the used-to-be famous.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Over the years Yanover (who isn&#8217;t an agent) helped start businesses like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.funnyordie.com\/\">Funny or Die<\/a>; launched CAA&#8217;s venture capital fund, <a href=\"https:\/\/ventures.caa.com\/\">CAA Ventures<\/a>; and co-founded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hauslabs.com\/\">Haus Laboratories<\/a>, the cosmetic business launched in collaboration with Stefani Germanotta (also known as Lady Gaga).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But it&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativelabs.co\/\">Creative Labs<\/a>, a Vancouver-based business incubator that collaborates with CAA talent to build startup companies,\u00a0that may prove to be the company that vindicates Yanover&#8217;s belief that new businesses can help shape the future of Hollywood&#8217;s big agencies.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">At CAA, this presents another way for the company to operate in a way that aligns with what the agency&#8217;s new owner, TPG Capital, thought when it acquired a majority stake in the company.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8220;We were intrigued by CAA because they&#8217;re in the middle of the ferment that&#8217;s going on in this industry, but they&#8217;ve been brokers instead of principals, and we think they have plenty of opportunities to be principals,&#8221; David Bonderman, the co-head of TPG Capital <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/features\/inside-saga-secrets-sale-caa-912464\">is quoted as saying in The Hollywood Reporter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The timing couldn&#8217;t be better.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For nearly a year, Hollywood agents and the Writers Guild of America have been locked in a bitter battle over a fairly arcane part of the industry &#8212; the collection of packaging fees and expansion of the agency business into production and distribution.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Packaging writing talent with celebrities for blockbuster productions was part of what made agencies like CAA power brokers in Hollywood and generated massive windfalls for clients and the agents who represented them. As new contracts from streaming services generate huge checks on the front end, but little-or-nothing in residual payments for the long-term success of a title or production over the course of its now near-infinite lifespan, agencies and their clients are looking for new ways to make money.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">It&#8217;s also putting the agents at odds with the talent they represent. The Writers Guild<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wga.org\/uploadedfiles\/members\/member_info\/agency_agreement\/Agencies_for_Sale_WGA_31819.pdf\"> laid out their claims<\/a> in a fascinating report a few years ago.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>The major Hollywood agencies now make much of their money by demanding direct payments from the studios that employ their clients, known as \u201cpackaging\u201d fees, which are unrelated to their clients\u2019 compensation and come directly from TV series and film production budgets and profits. Packaging fees are a conflict of interest because they introduce direct negotiations between the agency and its client\u2019s employer over how much the agency will be paid. Agency success is severed from client income.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">CAA co-chairman Bryan Lourd has said the fight over packaging and production is a distraction from the real threat &#8212; the multinational technology development, telecommunications, production and distribution companies that control the direct pipelines to audiences.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8220;The unspoken strategy of these multinational content and distribution companies is to drive prices down and wipe out ownership for writers and creators,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2019\/biz\/news\/writers-guild-divisions-agents-battle-1203239075\/\">Lourd is quoted as saying<\/a>, in an article by Variety. \u201cThis is happening in real time as we\u2019ve sat here in limbo for these last two months, fighting with each other as opposed to cooperating with each other to face this real challenge.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The rise of YouTube, Snap, Instagram, TikTok and Twitch have created transparency around artist discovery, audience discovery, and performance monitoring and management in an entertainment business that thrives on its opacity. And Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, along with other deep-pocketed producers create new ways of doing business for entertainers.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the doors to reaching an audience wide open and new technology-enabled marketplaces emerging to connect brands with entertainers, agencies need to rethink their pitch.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8220;As celebs develop more direct channels to fans we will see more of this entrepreneurial activity,&#8221; according to Yanover. &#8220;For agencies it&#8217;s an essential part of our evolution with the talent.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1940711\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1940711\" class=\"breakout wp-image-1940711 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg 5337w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Yanover-Michael-2016.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1940711\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Michael Yanover, Business Development Head at CAA, Los Angeles, Calif. 10.8.15<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Back in 2003, with Silicon Valley still recovering from the collapse of the first generation of consumer companies built on the back of the Internet, Hollywood and Silicon Valley were still relatively strange bedfellows. And Yanover, a former executive in charge of developing video productions at the early multimedia streaming pioneer Atom\/Shockwave, was an ideal candidate to help bridge the gap.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He started building relationships between technology firms and the agency, leveraging connections with investors at some of Silicon Valley&#8217;s top venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital to bring in corporate clients and create new opportunities for the agency&#8217;s celebrity talent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&#8220;There&#8217;s three parts to my life here,&#8221; says Yanover. &#8220;One part is investing. The second part is I&#8217;ve created companies on behalf of CAA.

have all the right numbers in place to achieve a strong IPO? That&#8217;s the initial takeaway Alex Wilhelm has after One Medical&#8217;s successful debut this week. One might think it looks like a tech-enabled unicorn, that doesn&#8217;t generate the recurring revenue and margins of a true tech-powered business.<\/p>\n<p>But, the doctor-services provider closed up almost 40% on a somewhat ambitious price of $14 per share. It had raised $532.1 million during its time as a private company, with a fairly recent valuation of $1.71 billion. With its closing value of $19.50 per share today, One Medical is now worth $2.38 billion.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s despite gross margins under the 50% mark, deeply minority recurring revenue and 30% revenue growth in 2019 <em>at<\/em> <em>best<\/em>, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/31\/one-medicals-ipo-pops-40-after-conservative-pricing-in-boon-to-unicorn-liquidity\/\">Alex noted on Extra Crunch Friday<\/a>. It is now worth about 8.5x its trailing revenues.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;There are cash-generating SaaS companies that are growing only a bit more slowly that are trading for lower multiples,&#8221; he <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/23\/one-medical-targets-ipo-valuation-of-up-to-2b-as-we-unpack-its-q4-results\/\">has previously observed<\/a>. &#8220;I cannot see what makes the company \u2014 an unprofitable, only moderately growing upstart with non-recurring revenue \u2014 worth a SaaS multiple. Especially as its gross margins aren\u2019t great and aren\u2019t improving.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, mattress-seller Casper, which also filed new information about its IPO plans this week, has numbers that aren&#8217;t all that different. But it&#8217;s just hoping to not take too big of a haircut on its last private valuation, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/27\/caspers-valuation-could-fall-40-in-ipo-as-it-reports-2019-results\/\">Alex separately noted on EC<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe public investors still care about a great story, despite the rough debuts of Blue Apron, SmileDirect, WeWork and a range of others? Certainly, One Medical&#8217;s work to improve medical care is laudable regardless of these questions (in fact, it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/video\/one-medical-group-voted-best-health-startup-crunchies-2013\/\">won the Best Healthcare Startup Crunchie in 2013<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Stay tuned for more.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-1939279\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-730150957.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-730150957.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-730150957.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-730150957.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-730150957.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-730150957.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/GettyImages-730150957.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/30\/how-acquirers-look-at-your-company\/\">How acquirers look at your company<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say the public markets are not for you, though, and instead you want to get acquired.\u00a0Ed Byrne of Scaleworks looks at this both as a startup investor and, through a separate part of his company, as an acquirer, and has kindly provided a detailed explainer on Extra Crunch for startup founders.<\/p>\n<p>Here are his key deciders from the purchaser perspective:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Downside protection:<\/strong>\u00a0Are we confident we are not going to lose money?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Median:<\/strong>\u00a0If we work hard, focus on good business operations and execute the low-hanging fruit, will we be able to grow this business enough to make a solid return (solid return being an increased valuation multiple from a higher revenue base)?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Upside:<\/strong>\u00a0If one of our category creation ideas pans out, and we succeed in winning a very targeted segment of the market, is there an opportunity for this business to be a real winner and provide outsized returns?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<blockquote><p>Buying and taking on someone else\u2019s business is always a scary proposition \u2014 the unknown unknowns \u2014 but if you get comfortable with the fundamental of the company, acquisitions can be a real accelerator compared to the epic effort \u2014 and high risk \u2014 of starting from scratch.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2><img class=\"breakout alignnone size-full wp-image-932121\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/127879664.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/127879664.jpg 1360w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/127879664.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/127879664.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/127879664.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/127879664.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/12\/127879664.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/30\/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-travel-tourism-and-hospitality-tech\/\">Where top VCs are investing in travel, tourism and hospitality tech<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Want to build the next Airbnb?

And I think that\u2019s really encouraged a new next generation of entrepreneur. And Europe is changing its mindset that it\u2019s okay to fail.<\/p>\n<p>And I think the other shift is that now people are saying, \u201cokay, well, I\u2019m not going to move to the valley and trying to build my teams because talent is so competitive and so expensive over there, I want to build in Europe.\u201d And then finally, the great engineering, design, product talent here and then being helped by funds like us to scale it at the beginning and early stages, and then going on to produce some really interesting things. I don\u2019t think U.S. funds are coming over here because they see cheaper pricing and lower valuations.

Fifteen years later, Kan\u2019s original idea seems quaint, given the level of self-promotion and oversharing that&#8217;s become commonplace. And yet, as he was arguably the first person to turn surveillance capitalism into not only overt performance art but also a noteworthy career in startups and venture capital, one can\u2019t help but take the idea of Justin Kan seriously, at the very least as a harbinger of what is to come.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a free-wheeling interview, the serial entrepreneur covers a number of topics, including spirituality, stress and therapy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":133574325,"featured_media":1932420,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"jetpack_publicize_message":"Justin Kan opens up (Part 1) https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2GGGowL"},"categories":[25515,20429],"tags":[708639,8289,1278857,66455],"crunchbase_tag":[198296169],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Justin-Kan-Atrium.png","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2GGGowL","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"featured":true,"subtitle":"'I've always liked engaging in social media for my own entertainment'","fundingRound":false,"seoTitle":"","seoDescription":"","premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.2,"tc_cb_mapping":[{"slug":"justin-kan","cb_name":"Justin Kan","cb_slug":"justin-kan-person","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/justin-kan"},{"slug":"y-combinator","cb_name":"Y Combinator","cb_slug":"y-combinator-organization","cb_link":"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/y-combinator"}],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1791260],"hideFeaturedImage":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1940206"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1940206"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1940206\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1940469,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1940206\/revisions\/1940469"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/greg-epstein"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=1940206&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/133574325"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1932420"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1940206"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1940206"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1940206"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=1940206"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=1940206"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=1940206"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1791260,"name":"Greg Epstein","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/greg-epstein\/","description":"Greg M.

famously tricky real estate market has long drawn international investors to the region in search of tech solutions. This time, Brazilian startup <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/how-two-year-old-loft-nabbed-175m-led-by-andreessen-horowitz\/\">Loft brought in a <\/a><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/how-two-year-old-loft-nabbed-175m-led-by-andreessen-horowitz\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$175 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/03\/how-two-year-old-loft-nabbed-175m-led-by-andreessen-horowitz\/\">\u00a0Series C<\/a> from first-time investor in the region, Vulcan Capital (Paul Allen\u2019s investment arm), alongside Andreessen Horowitz. Loft is also a16z\u2019s first and only Brazilian investment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Co-founded by serial entrepreneurs and investors Mate Pencz and Florian Hagenbuch in 2018, Loft uses a proprietary algorithm to process transaction data and provide more transparent pricing for both buyers and sellers. The startup uses two models to help clients sell properties; either Loft will value the apartment for listing on the site, or they will offer to purchase the property from the buyer immediately. Many real estate platforms in the U.S. are shifting toward a similar iBuyer model; however, this system may be even more apt for the Latin American market, where property sales are notoriously untransparent, bureaucratic and tedious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loft will use the capital to expand to Rio de Janeiro in Q1 2020 and to Mexico City in Q2, bringing on at least 100 new employees in the process. It also plans to scale its financial products to include mortgages and insurance by the end of the year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AlphaCredit raises $125M from SoftBank<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mexican consumer lending startup <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/mexicos-alphacredit-lands-125m-in-softbank-led-series-b\/\">AlphaCredit became SoftBank\u2019s new Mexico bet<\/a> this month, with a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$125 million<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Series B round. AlphaCredit uses a programmed deduction system to provide rapid, online loans to individuals and small businesses in Mexico. To date, the startup has granted more than $1 billion in loans to small business clients in Mexico and Colombia, many of whom have never previously had access to financing.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AlphaCredit\u2019s programmed deductions system enables the startup to lower default rates, which in turn lowers interest rates. For more than eight years, AlphaCredit has encouraged financial inclusion in Mexico and Colombia through technology; this round of investment will enable the platform to consolidate its holding as one of the top lending platforms in the region. The investment is still subject to approval by Mexico\u2019s competition authority, COFECE, which has previously blocked startup deals such as the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/11\/uber-to-acquire-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop\/\">Cornershop <\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acquisition<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in 2019.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SoftBank\u2019s biggest bets back off in Latin America<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While SoftBank is still rapidly deploying its Latin America-focused Innovation Fund, some of its largest companies are stepping on the brakes. In particular, SoftBank\u2019s largest LatAm investment, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-rappi-softbank-layoffs\/softbank-backed-delivery-app-rappi-lays-off-6-of-workers-idUSKBN1Z82SO\">Rappi, recently announced that it would lay off<\/a> up to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6%<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of its workforce in an effort to cut costs and focus on their technology. The Colombian unicorn has been expanding at a breakneck pace throughout the region using a blitzscaling technique that has helped it reach nine countries, with 5,000 employees in just two years, including <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/latamlist.com\/2019\/12\/08\/rappi-reaches-100k-users-in-ecuador\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecuador<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in November 2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rappi has stated that it will focus on technology and UX in 2020, explaining that the job cuts do not reflect its long-term growth strategy. However, Rappi is also facing <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/latamlist.com\/2020\/01\/25\/rappi-founders-accused-of-stealing-intellectual-property\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">legal action<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for alleged intellectual property theft. Mauricio Paba, Jos\u00e9 Mendoza and Jorge Uribe are suing Rappi CEO Simon Borrero and the company for stealing the idea for the Rappi platform while providing consulting for the three founders through his firm, Imaginamos. The case is currently being processed in Colombia and the U.S.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of SoftBank\u2019s biggest bets in Asia, Oyo Rooms, is facing similar challenges. Just months after announcing their expansion into Mexico, Oyo fired thousands of employees in China and India. Oyo plans to be the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">largest<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hotel chain in Mexico by the end of 2020, according to a local spokesperson.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Argentina\u2019s Agrofy breaks regional agtech records<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/latamlist.com\/2020\/01\/12\/sp-ventures-leads-23m-investment-in-argentinas-agrofy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$23 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Series B from SP Ventures, Fall Line Capital and Acre Venture Partners, Argentine agricultural supply marketplace Agrofy has raised the region\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/lavca.org\/2020\/01\/12\/sp-ventures-and-others-invest-in-agrofy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">largest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> round for an agtech startup to date. The platform provides transparency and ease for the agricultural industry, where users can buy everything from tractors to seeds. In four years, Agrofy has established itself as the market leader in agricultural e-commerce; it was also Fall Line Capital\u2019s first investment outside of the U.S.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Agrofy is active in nine countries and receives more than five million visits per month, 60% of which come from Brazil. However, the startup faces the challenge of low connectivity in rural areas, where most of its customers live. The investment will go to improving the platform, as well as integrating new payment types directly into the site to help clients process their transactions more smoothly.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">News and Notes: Fanatiz, Pachama, Moons, Didi and IDB<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Miami-based sports-streaming platform Fanatiz raised <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/latamlist.com\/2020\/01\/14\/fanatiz-receives-10m-series-a-from-777-partners\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$10 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0in a Series A round from 777 Partners in January 2020 after registering 125% user growth since July 2019. Founded by Chilean Matias Rivera, Fanatiz provides legal international streaming of soccer and other sports through a personalized platform so that fans can follow their teams from anywhere in the world. The startup provided the Pope with an account so that he could follow his beloved team, San Lorenzo, from the Vatican. Fanatiz has previously received investment from <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Magma Partners<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and participated in 500 Startups\u2019 Miami Scale program.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conservation-tech startup Pachama raised <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/latamlist.com\/2020\/01\/14\/tech-startup-pachama-raises-4-1m-to-support-carbon-offset-projects\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$4.1 million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from Silicon Valley investors to continue developing a carbon offset marketplace using drone and lidar data. Pachama was founded by Argentine entrepreneur Diego Saez-Gil in 2019 after he noticed the effects of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon.

With 18 locations in Mexico and two in Colombia, Moons is expanding rapidly across the region, with ambitions for providing low-cost healthcare across several verticals in Latin America.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chinese ride-hailing startup Didi Chuxing recently <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">launched<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a sustainable fleet of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.globalfleet.com\/en\/technology-and-innovation\/latin-america\/features\/didi-launch-electrified-ride-hailing-fleet-mexico?a=DBL10&amp;t%5B0%5D=Didi%20Chuxing&amp;t%5B1%5D=Ride%20hailing&amp;t%5B2%5D=electric%20vehicle&amp;t%5B3%5D=Hybrid&amp;t%5B4%5D=Mexico&amp;curl=1\"> over 700 electric and hybrid cars for its Mexico City operations<\/a>.

Nonetheless, 59% of the 1,148 women surveyed still see access to capital as the most significant limitation for their companies.

<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u2014<\/span> Africa&#8217;s most populous nation with the continent&#8217;s largest economy and leading tech sector.<\/p>\n<p>The restrictions would stop short of placing a full travel ban on the country of 200 million, but will suspend U.S. immigrant visas for Nigeria, along with Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar.<\/p>\n<p>That applies to citizens from those countries looking to live permanently in the U.S. The latest restrictions are said not to apply to non-immigrant, temporary visas for tourist, business, and medical visits.<\/p>\n<p>Tanzania and Sudan also face new restrictions. Both countries were suspended from <a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/us-visas\/immigrate\/diversity-visa-program-entry.html\">U.S. diversity visa program<\/a>, also known as the green card lottery.<\/p>\n<p>The news was first reported by <a href=\"https:\/\/apnews.com\/cc950f2201d17f6e49311ae1909ebb1c\">the Associated Press<\/a>, after a briefing by Acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf. The Department of Homeland Security later provided TechCrunch with Wolf&#8217;s remarks and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dhs.gov\/news\/2020\/01\/31\/raising-global-travel-security-bar-dhs-announces-new-travel-restrictions-six\">summary<\/a> on the measures.<\/p>\n<p>The primary reason for the new restrictions, according to DHS, was that the countries did not &#8220;meet the Department&#8217;s stronger security standards.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Secretary Wolf noted, &#8220;the restrictions are not permanent if the country commits to change.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The move follows<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/27\/trumps-travel-ban-could-extend-to-africas-top-tech-country-nigeria\/\"> reporting over the last week<\/a> that the Trump administration was considering adding Nigeria, and several additional African states, to the list of predominantly Muslim countries on its 2017 travel ban.

proposed orbital tasks like reconfiguring or repairing a satellite or manufacturing new components from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing the Restore-L spacecraft will do is show that it can synchronize with, capture, connect with and refuel a satellite in orbit, then release it into a new orbit. Afterwards the craft will use the Maxar-built robotic arm to assemble a multi-panel antenna reflector, then test it.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-1940590\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/maxar-spider.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"499\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Last, a separate piece of hardware, Tethers Unlimited&#8217;s MakerSat, will extrude a beam some 10-20 meters long, which will be inspected by the parent satellite, then detached and reattached to demonstrate its robustness.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are continuing America\u2019s global leadership in space technology by proving we can assemble spacecraft with larger and more powerful components, after launch,&#8221; said NASA&#8217;s Jim Reuter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/press-release\/nasa-funds-demonstration-of-assembly-and-manufacturing-in-space\">in a news post<\/a>. &#8220;This technology demonstration will open up a new world of in-space robotic capabilities.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no hard timeline for the mission yet, but it&#8217;s intended to take off the mid 2020s. This isn&#8217;t a small-scale experiment that can fly up next week in an Electron \u2014 it&#8217;s a big, expensive one that will likely take up most of a large rocket&#8217;s payload.<\/p>\n<p>Although it&#8217;s only a demonstration, a Maxar representative pointed out that it is very close to what would be an operational system on other satellites in the future. It has also been previously demoed on the ground, though of course that&#8217;s no substitute for the real thing.<\/p>\n<p>Robotic arms are something of a specialty for Maxar, which has delivered six total for NASA, including the one on Insight (currently on the Red Planet) and the Mars 2020 Rover (due to receive its official, inspirational name any day now).<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll have Maxar&#8217;s head of space robotics<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/01\/06\/maxars-space-robotics-head-lucy-condakchian-is-coming-to-tc-sessions-roboticsai\/\"> onstage at TC Sessions: Robotics + AI<\/a> in March at UC Berkeley, so be sure to join us there if you&#8217;d like to hear more about the business of building space robots.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">SPIDER will be integrated with the spacecraft bus Maxar is building for <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NASA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NASA<\/a> Restore-L project, which will refuel a satellite in low Earth orbit.

noreferrer\"> accounted<\/span><\/a> for nearly $518 billion in revenue in the United States alone last year. The growing number of online marketplaces like Amazon and eBay will command <a href=\"https:\/\/readwrite.com\/2018\/10\/30\/how-digital-marketplaces-will-again-redefine-commerce-and-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40%<\/a> of the global retail market in 2020. As the number of digital offerings \u2014 not only marketplaces but also online storefronts and company websites \u2014 available to consumers continues to grow, the primary challenge for any online platform lies in setting itself apart.<\/p>\n<p>The central question for how to accomplish this: Where does differentiation matter most?<\/p>\n<p>A customer\u2019s ability to easily (and accurately) find a specific product or service with minimal barriers helps ensure they feel satisfied and confident with their choice of purchase. This ultimately becomes the differentiator that sets an online platform apart. It\u2019s about coupling a stellar product with an exceptional experience. Often, that takes the form of simple, searchable access to a wide variety of products and services. Sometimes, it\u2019s about surfacing a brand that meets an individual consumer\u2019s needs or price point. In both cases, platforms are in a position to help customers avoid having to chase down a product or service through multiple clicks while offering a better way of comparing apples to apples.<\/p>\n<p>To be successful, a company should adopt a consumer-first philosophy that informs its product ideation and development process. A successful consumer-first development resides in a company\u2019s ability to expediently deliver fresh features that customers actually respond to, rather than prioritize the update that seems most profitable. The best way to inform both elements is to consistently collect and learn from customer feedback in a timely way \u2014 and sometimes, this will mean making decisions for the benefit of consumers versus what is in the best interest of companies.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To be successful, a company should adopt a

href=\"https:\/\/www.givelegacy.com\/team\">Legacy<\/a>, a male fertility startup, has just raised a fresh, $3.5 million in funding from Bill Maris&#8217;s San Diego-based venture firm, Section 32, along with Y Combinator and Bain Capital Ventures, which led a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/06\/legacy-a-sperm-testing-and-freezing-service-raises-1-5m\/\">$1.5 million<\/a> seed round for the Boston startup last year.<\/p>\n<p>We talked earlier today with <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/legacy\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"legacy\">Legacy&#8217;s <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> founder and CEO Khaled Kteily about his now two-year-old, five-person startup and its big ambitions to become the world&#8217;s preeminent male fertility center. Our biggest question was how Legacy and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/01\/31\/dadi-brings-in-2m\/\">similar startups<\/a> convince men &#8212; who are generally less concerned with their fertility than women &#8212; that they need the company&#8217;s at-home testing kits and services in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They <em>should<\/em> be worried about [their fertility],&#8221; said Kteily, a former healthcare and life sciences consultant with a master&#8217;s degree in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School. &#8220;Sperm counts have gone down 50 to 60% over the last 40 years.&#8221; More from our chat with Legacy, a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/30\/legacy-wins-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-berlin-2018\/\">former TechCrunch Battlefield winner<\/a>, follows; it has been edited lightly for length.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Why start this company?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: I didn&#8217;t grow up wanting to be the king of sperm [laughs]. But I had a pretty bad accident &#8212; a second-degree burn on my legs after having four hot Starbucks teas spill on my lap in a car &#8212; and between that and a colleague at the Kennedy School who&#8217;d been diagnosed with cancer and whose doctor suggested he freeze his sperm ahead of his radiation treatments, it just clicked for me that maybe I should also save my sperm. When I went into Cambridge to do this, the place was right next to the restaurant Dumpling House and it was just very awkward and expensive and I thought, there must be a better way of doing this.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How do you get started on something like this?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: This was before Ro and Hims began taking off, but people were increasingly comfortable doing things from their own homes, so I started doing research around the idea. I joined the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. I started taking continuing education classes about sperm&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Women are under so much pressure from the time they turn 30 to monitor their fertility. Aside from extreme circumstances, as with your friend, do men really think about testing their sperm?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: Men should be worried about it, and they should be taking responsibility for it. What a lot of folks don&#8217;t know is for every one in seven couples that are actively trying to get pregnant, the man is equally responsible [for their fertility struggles]. Women are taught about their fertility but men aren&#8217;t, yet the quality of their sperm is degrading over the years. Sperm counts have gone down by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6455044\/\">50 to 60%<\/a> over the last 40 years, too.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Wait, what? Why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: [Likely culprits are] chemicals in plastics, chemicals in what we eat eat and drink, changes in lifestyle; we move less and eat more, and sperm health relates to overall health. I also think mobile phones are causing it. I will caveat this by saying there&#8217;s been mixed research, but I&#8217;m convinced that cell phones are the new smoking in that it wasn&#8217;t clear that smoking was as dangerous as it is when the research was being conducted by companies that benefited by [perpetuating cigarette use]. There&#8217;s also a generational decline in sperm quality [to consider]; it poses increased risk to the mother but also the child, as the risk of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/03\/25\/well\/family\/the-risks-to-babies-of-older-fathers.html\">gestational diabetes<\/a> goes up, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/national\/health-science\/the-link-between-autism-and-older-parents-is-clear-but-the-why-is-not\/2017\/12\/15\/dbe03284-dc62-11e7-b859-fb0995360725_story.html\">the rate of autism<\/a> and other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2566050\/\">congenital conditions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;re selling directly to consumers. Are you also working with companies to incorporate your tests in their overall wellness offerings?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: We&#8217;re investing heavily in business-to-business and expect that to be a huge acquisition channel for us. We can&#8217;t share any names yet, but we just signed a big company last week and have a few more in the works. These are mostly Bay Area companies right now; it&#8217;s an area where our experience as a YC alum was valuable because of the founders who&#8217;ve gone through and now run large companies of their own.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: When you&#8217;re talking with investors, how do you describe the market size?\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: There are four million couples that are facing fertility challenges and in all cases, we believe the man should be tested. So do [their significant others]. Almost half of purchases [of our kits] are by a female partner. We also see men in the military freezing their sperm before being deployed, same-sex couples who plan to use a surrogate at some point and transgender patients who are looking at a life-changing [moment] and want to preserve their fertility before they start the process. But we see this as something that every man might do as they go off to college, and investors see that bigger picture.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How much do the kits and storage cost?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: The kit costs $195 up front, and if they choose to store their sperm, $145 a year. We offer different packages. You can also spend $1,995 for two deposits and 10 years of storage.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Is one or two samples effective? According to the Mayo Clinic, sperm counts fluctuate meaningfully from one sample to the next, so they suggest semen analysis tests over a period of time to ensure accurate results.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: We encourage our clients to make multiple deposits. The scores will be variable, but they&#8217;ll gather around an average.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: But they are charged for these deposits separately?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: Yes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: And what are you looking for?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: Volume, count, concentration, motility and morphology [meaning the shape of the sperm].<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: Who, exactly, is doing the analysis and handling the storage?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: We partner with Andrology Labs in Chicago on analysis; it&#8217;s one of the top fertility labs in the country. For storage, we partner with a couple of cryo-storage providers in different geographies. We divide the samples into four, then store them in two different tanks within each of two locations. We want to make sure we&#8217;re never in a position where [the samples are accidentally destroyed, as has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/03\/13\/health\/eggs-freezing-storage-safety.html\">happened at clinics elsewhere<\/a>].<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: I can imagine fears about these samples being mishandled. How can you assure customers this won&#8217;t happen?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: Trust and legitimacy are core factors and a huge area of focus for us. We&#8217;re CPPA and HIPAA compliant. All [related data] is encrypted and anonymized and every customer receives a unique ID [which is a series of digits so that even the storage facilities don&#8217;t know whose sperm they are handling]. We have extreme redundancies and processes in place to ensure that we&#8217;re handling [samples] in the most scientifically rigorous way possible, as well as ensuring the safety and privacy of each [specimen].<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How long can sperm be frozen?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: Indefinitely.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TC: How will you use all the data you&#8217;ll be collecting?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>KK: I could see us entering into partnerships with research institutions. What we won&#8217;t do is sell it like 23andMe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Legacy, a male fertility startup, has just raised a fresh, $3.5 million in funding from Bill Maris&#8217;s San Diego-based venture firm, Section 32, along with Y Combinator and Bain Capital Ventures, which led a $1.5 million seed round for the Boston startup last year.

I\u2019ve been on the Midas List for the past three years and was recently named on The New York Times\u2019 list of The Top 20 Venture Capitalists. In 2008, I co-founded <a href=\"https:\/\/floodgate.com\/\">Floodgate<\/a>, one of the first seed-stage VC funds in Silicon Valley. Unlike most funds, we invest exclusively in seed, making us experts in finding product-market fit and building a minimum viable company. Seed is fundamentally different from later stages, so we\u2019ve made it more than a specialty: It\u2019s all we do. Each of our partners sees thousands of companies every year before electing to invest in only the top three or four.<\/p>\n<p>For the past 11 years, I&#8217;ve invested at the inception phase of startups. We&#8217;ve seen startups go wildly right (Lyft, Refinery29, Twitch, Xamarin) and wildly wrong.

This value also determines how you package your product to the world (freemium versus free to pay versus enterprise sales).<\/li>\n<li>Your business model and pricing must fit your ecosystem. They must also generate enough sales volume and revenue to sustain your business.<\/li>\n<li>Your product\u2019s value must satisfy the needs of the ecosystem and the ecosystem needs to accept your product.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Many entrepreneurs conceptualize product-market fit as the point where some subset of customers love their product\u2019s features. <b>This conceptualization is dangerous.<\/b> Many failing companies have features that customers loved.

Join roughly 1,500 experts, visionaries, creators, founders, investors, researchers and engineers. Rub elbows, network and engage with current and aspiring leaders, as well as students poised to drive future innovation.<\/p>\n<p>We have a stellar line up, and just because we\u2019re biased doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re wrong. I mean come on \u2014 assistive robots, ethics and AI, the state of VC investment and robot demos. And that\u2019s just for starters. Here are a couple of specific examples (peruse the full agenda right <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-robotics-ai-2020\/#5cbbd4a5-7979-4e5d-a66a-c55b6badd683\">here<\/a>):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cultivating Intelligence in Agricultural Robots:<\/strong> The benefits of robotics in agriculture are undeniable, yet at the same time only getting started. Lewis Anderson (Traptic) and Sebastien Boyer (FarmWise) will compare notes on the rigors of developing industrial-grade robots that both pick crops and weed fields, respectively. Pyka\u2019s Michael Norcia will discuss taking flight over those fields with an autonomous crop-spraying drone.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Building the Robots that Build:<\/strong> Join Daniel Blank (Toggle), Tessa Lau (Dusty Robotics) and Noah Ready-Campbell (Built Robotics) as they discuss whether robots can help us build structures faster, smarter and cheaper. Built Robotics makes a self-driving excavator. Toggle is developing a new fabrication of rebar for reinforced concrete and Dusty Robotics builds robot-powered tools. We\u2019ll talk with the founders to learn how and when robots will become a part of the construction crew.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And in case you haven\u2019t heard, we\u2019ve added <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/events\/tc-sessions-robotics-ai-2020\/pitch-night\/\">Pitch Night<\/a>, a mini pitch-off, into the mix this year.

TechCrunch editors will review the applications and choose 10 startups to pitch at a private event the night before the conference. A panel of VC judges will select five teams as finalists. Those founders will pitch again the next day \u2014 live from the Main Stage.
