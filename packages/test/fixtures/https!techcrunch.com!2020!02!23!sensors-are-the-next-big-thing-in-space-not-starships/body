				<p id="speakable-summary"><span class="featured__span-first-words">Understanding the opportunities</span> available in the space industry — especially for early-stage companies and new founders — isn&#8217;t easy.</p>
<p>The pool of people who have deep aerospace technical expertise isn&#8217;t huge, and like any community that requires a high degree of specialist knowledge, it&#8217;s a tightly-knit field that relies on social connections. But space is increasingly opening up, and we&#8217;ve already reached a point where the most valuable new entrants might come from industries that aren&#8217;t specifically aerospace or aerospace-adjacent.</p>
<p>In fact, we could be reaching a stage where the parts of the space industry requiring actual rocket scientists are more or less saturated, while the real boon is set to come from crossover talent that develops new ways to leverage innovations in other areas on space-based operating platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have enough low-Earth launch vehicles, we have enough rockets,&#8221; Bessemer VP <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/tess-hatch" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="tess-hatch">Tess Hatch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told me in an interview at the FAA&#8217;s Commercial Space Transportation Conference last month. &#8220;In 2020, we have even more coming online and a lot of the &#8216;fantasy&#8217; ones [an industry term used to describe spacecraft that have been conceived and designed but not yet flown] are planning to launch, and I think maybe one of them will come to fruition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hatch says she still sees much of the demand side of the industry cluster around existing and proven suppliers, even if new entrants, including Astra and Firefly, actually begin flying their rockets this year, as both have been planning. Companies like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rocket-lab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rocket-lab">Rocket Lab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (in which her company has a stake) will increase their volume and cadence and benefit from having a proven track record, taking up a lot of the growth in launch vehicle demand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s room for any more rockets in the industry,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Instead, Hatch is looking to payload variety and innovation as the next big thing in space tech. Satellites are becoming increasingly commoditized, and companies like Rocket Lab are looking to take this further by providing a satellite platform (Proton) as part of its launch offering. There&#8217;s still immaturity in the small-satellite supply chain, which is what led small-satellite operator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/why-kepler-is-building-its-full-stack-satellite-business-in-canada/">Kepler to build its own</a>, but the bigger opportunity isn&#8217;t in building satellites — it&#8217;s in equipping them with new, improved and radically redesigned sensors to gather new kinds of data and provide new kinds of services.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>			</div>

any community that requires a high degree of specialist knowledge, it&#8217;s a tightly-knit field that relies on social connections. But space is increasingly opening up, and we&#8217;ve already reached a point where the most valuable new entrants might come from industries that aren&#8217;t specifically aerospace or aerospace-adjacent.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, we could be reaching a stage where the parts of the space industry requiring actual rocket scientists are more or less saturated, while the real boon is set to come from crossover talent that develops new ways to leverage innovations in other areas on space-based operating platforms.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We have enough low-Earth launch vehicles, we have enough rockets,&#8221; Bessemer VP <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/person\/tess-hatch\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"tess-hatch\">Tess Hatch <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> told me in an interview at the FAA&#8217;s Commercial Space Transportation Conference last month. &#8220;In 2020, we have even more coming online and a lot of the &#8216;fantasy&#8217; ones [an industry term used to describe spacecraft that have been conceived and designed but not yet flown] are planning to launch, and I think maybe one of them will come to fruition.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hatch says she still sees much of the demand side of the industry cluster around existing and proven suppliers, even if new entrants, including Astra and Firefly, actually begin flying their rockets this year, as both have been planning. Companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/rocket-lab\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"rocket-lab\">Rocket Lab <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> (in which her company has a stake) will increase their volume and cadence and benefit from having a proven track record, taking up a lot of the growth in launch vehicle demand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s room for any more rockets in the industry,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Hatch is looking to payload variety and innovation as the next big thing in space tech. Satellites are becoming increasingly commoditized, and companies like Rocket Lab are looking to take this further by providing a satellite platform (Proton) as part of its launch offering. There&#8217;s still immaturity in the small-satellite supply chain, which is what led small-satellite operator <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/18\/why-kepler-is-building-its-full-stack-satellite-business-in-canada\/\">Kepler to build its own<\/a>, but the bigger opportunity isn&#8217;t in building satellites \u2014 it&#8217;s in equipping them with new, improved and radically redesigned sensors to gather new kinds of data and provide new kinds of services.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Understanding the opportunities available in the space industry \u2014 especially for early-stage companies and new founders \u2014 isn&#8217;t easy.

rest of the world. The coronavirus outbreak is posing a devastating impact on people&#8217;s life and the economy in China, but there&#8217;s a silver lining that the epidemic might have benefited a few players in the technology industry as the population remains indoors.<\/p>\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\">The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus that infected thousands and killed hundreds in China back in 2002 is widely seen as a catalyst for the country&#8217;s fledgling e-commerce industry.

In December, WeChat Work <a href=\"https:\/\/new.qq.com\/omn\/TEC20191\/TEC2019122300963200.html\">announced<\/a> it had logged more than 2.5 million enterprises and some 60 million active users.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Lark, launched only in 2019, pales in comparison to its two predecessors, hovering around the 300th mark in early February. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Nonetheless, Lark appears to be making a big user acquisition push recently by placing ads on its sibling Douyin, TikTok&#8217;s China version. Douyin has emerged as a marketing darling as advertisers rush to embrace vertical, short videos, and Lark can certainly benefit from exposure on the red-hot app. WeChat, despite its colossal one-billion monthly user base, has remained restrained in ad monetization.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">The question is whether the sudden boom will develop into a sustainable growth trend for these apps. <a href=\"http:\/\/companies.caixin.com\/2020-02-03\/101511187.html\">System crashes<\/a> on DingTalk and WeChat Work due to user influx at the start of the remote working regime might suggest that neither had projected such traffic volumes on its growth curve.<\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">\u00a0<\/span>After all, most businesses are expected to resume in-person communication when safety conditions are ensured.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, the work-from-home model has been widely <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/work\/1802044\/what-its-like-to-work-from-home-in-coronavirus-hit-china\/\">ill-received by employees<\/a> who are frustrated with intrusive company rules like<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> &#8220;keep your webcam on while working from home.&#8221; In a more unexpected turn, DingTalk suffered from a<\/span>\u00a0backlash<span style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\"> after it added tools to host online classes for students. Resentful that the app had spoiled their extended holiday, young users flooded to give DingTalk <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/uk-china-health-alibaba\/alibabas-dingtalk-gets-bad-grades-from-chinas-stuck-at-home-students-idUKKBN20B14D\">one-star ratings.<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Face mask algorithms<\/h2>\n<p>To curb the spread of the virus, local governments in China have mandated people to wear masks in public, posing a potential challenge to the country&#8217;s omnipresent facial recognition-powered identity checks. But the technologies necessary to handle the situation is already in place, such as iris scanning.<\/p>\n<p>Travelers whom I spoke to reported they are now able to pass through train station security without taking their masks off &#8212; which could sound an alarm to privacy-conscious individuals. But it&#8217;s unclear whether the change is due to more advanced forms of biometrics technologies or that the authority had temporarily loosened security on low-risk individuals. People still have to scan their ID cards before getting their biometrics verified and travelers whose identities have been flagged could trigger stricter screening, people familiar with China&#8217;s AI industry told me. They added that the latter case is more probable, for it will take time to implement a nationwide infrastructure upgrade.<\/p>\n<h2>Digital passes<\/h2>\n<p>Local governments have also introduced tools for people to attain digital records of their travel history, which has become some sort of permit to go about their daily life, be it returning to work, their apartment, or even the city they live in.<\/p>\n<p>One example is web-based app <a href=\"https:\/\/www.abacusnews.com\/tech\/how-big-data-helps-china-track-coronavirus-and-its-people\/article\/3050507\">Close Contact Detector <\/a>developed by a state-owned company. Users can obtain a record of their travel history by opting to submit their names, ID numbers and phone numbers. So far the app has drawn more scorn than praise for containing the virus, bringing people to the questions: If the government already has a grip on people&#8217;s travel history, why didn&#8217;t it react earlier to restrict the free flow of travelers? Why did it only introduce the service a few weeks after the first big outbreak?<\/p>\n<p>All of this could point to the challenge of collecting and consolidating citizen data across departments and regions, despite China&#8217;s ongoing efforts to encourage the use of social credits nationwide through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chinalawtranslate.com\/en\/china-social-credit-score\/\">use of real-name registration and big data.<\/a> The health crisis appears to have accelerated this data-unification process. The pressing question is how the government will utilize these data following the outbreak.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Eg migrants who\u2019d been in Hubei slipped through the cracks while 10s of thousands Hubeiren outside the province are left stranded (what\u2019s all that use of SIM card location tracking +face scans?) and SH gov\u2019t late to disclose affected neighborhoods (data supposedly easy to attain)<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Rita Liao (@ritacyliao) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ritacyliao\/status\/1227483970188738560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 12, 2020<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Many of these digital permits are powered by WeChat on the merit of the messenger&#8217;s ubiquity and broad-ranging functions in Chinese society.

While we wait for the seven-year-old company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/06\/robinhood-ipo\/\">long-planned<\/a> IPO, Alex Wilhelm examined Morgan Stanley&#8217;s big $13 billion purchase of E-Trade for fresh data comparison points. Robinhood has 10 million accounts \u2014 twice what E-Trade has \u2014 but it also appears to make much less money per user and has far fewer assets under management, as he <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/what-the-13b-etrade-deal-says-about-robinhoods-valuation\/\">covered for Extra Crunch<\/a>. So while its fee-free approach has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/02\/robinhood-e-trade-schwab-ameritrade\/\">destroyed<\/a> a key revenue stream for competitors, it still has to grow its own &#8220;order-flow&#8221; business into its private-market valuation.<\/p>\n<p>One solution is to make the platform stickier via social features. On the same day as the E-Trade deal announcement, Robinhood launched a new Profiles feature to encourage users to share stock tips. Josh Constine <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/20\/robinhood-profiles-morgan-stanley-etrade\/\">explored the offering<\/a> and where it is headed on TechCrunch, concluding that &#8220;Profiles and lists, and then eventually more social features, could get Robinhood\u2019s users trading more so there\u2019s more order flow to sell and more reason for them to buy subscriptions.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Alex also took a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/fintech-vc-sets-records-in-q4-despite-early-stage-slowdown\/\">look at a new report on fintech funding<\/a>, which found last year was a peak overall \u2014 but skewed towards later-stage companies. Certainly, the wealth management segment is looking mature.<\/p>\n<p>But the category is massive, with many more incumbents left to disrupt. What are fintech investors looking for?

Capital Partners&#8217;<\/span> co-founder and CEO Mark Tluszcz is brimming with enthusiasm for what\u2019s coming down the pipe from health tech startups.<\/p>\n<p>Populations armed with mobile devices and hungry for verified and relevant information, combined with the promise of big data and AI, is converging, as he sees it, into a massive opportunity for businesses to rethink how healthcare is delivered, both as a major platform to plugging gaps in stretched public healthcare systems and multiple spaces in between \u2014 serving up something more specific and intimate.<\/p>\n<p>Think health-focused digital communities, perhaps targeting a single sex or time of life, as we&#8217;re increasingly seeing in the femtech space, or health-focused apps and services that can act as supportive spaces and sounding boards that cater to the particular biological needs of different groups of people.<\/p>\n<p>Tluszcz has made some savvy bets in his time. He was an early investor in Skype, turning a $2 million investment into $200 million, and he\u2019s also made a tidy profit backing web building platform Wix, where he remains as chairman. But the long-time, early-stage tech investor has a new focus after a clutch of investments \u2014 in period tracking (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/12\/15\/flo-raises-1m-led-by-flint-capital-for-its-ai-driven-period-calculator\/\">Flo<\/a>), AI diagnostics (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/12\/17\/k-health-raises-25m-for-its-ai-powered-primary-care-platform\/\">K Health<\/a>) and digital therapeutics (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2013\/10\/22\/can-you-click-your-way-to-happiness-new-self-help-service-for-the-stressed-sad-happify-makes-big-claims\/\">Happify<\/a>) \u2014 have garnered enough momentum to make health the dominant theme of Mangrove Capital\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/07\/19\/mangrove-raises-170m-for-its-new-fund-to-invest-in-europe-and-israeli-startups\/\">last fund<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI really don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a bigger area and a more inefficient area today than healthcare,\u201d he tells us. \u201cOne of the things that that whole space is missing is just good usability. And that\u2019s something that Internet entrepreneurs do very well.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Extra Crunch sat down for an in-depth conversation with Tluszcz to dig into the reasons why he\u2019s so excited about mHealth (as Mangrove calls it) and probe him on some of the challenges that arise when building data-led AI businesses with the potential to deeply impact people\u2019s lives.<\/p>\n<p>The fund has also produced a healthcare <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mangrove.vc\/healthcare-report\">report<\/a>\u00a0setting out some of its thinking.<\/p>\n<p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity<\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>TechCrunch: Is the breadth of what can fall in the digital health or mHealth category part of why you\u2019re so excited about the opportunities here?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Mark Tluszcz:<\/strong> I think if you take a step back, even from definitions for a moment, and you look around as an investor \u2014 and we as a firm, we happen to be thematically driven but no matter who you are \u2014 and you say where are there massive pockets of opportunity? And it\u2019s typically in areas where there\u2019s a lot of inefficiency. And anybody who\u2019s tried to go to the doctor anywhere in Europe or around the world or tried to get an appointment with a therapist or whatever realizes how basically inefficient and arcane that process is. From finding out who the right person is, to getting an appointment and going there and paying for it. So healthcare looks to us like one of those arcane industries \u2014 the user experience, so to speak, could be so much better. And combine that with the fact that in most cases we know nothing as individuals about health \u2014 unless you read a few books and things. But it\u2019s generally the one place where you\u2019re the least informed in life. So you go see your GP and he or she will tell you something and you\u2019re blindly going to take that pill they\u2019re going to give you because you\u2019re not well informed. You don\u2019t understand it.<\/p>\n<p>So I think that\u2019s the exciting part about it. If I now look around and say if I now look at all the industries in the world \u2014 and of course there\u2019s interesting stuff happening in financial services, and it continues to happen on commerce, and many, many places \u2014 but I really don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a bigger area and a more inefficient area today than healthcare.<\/p>\n<p>You combine that with the power that we\u2019re beginning to see in all these mobile devices \u2014 i.e. I have it in my pocket at all times. So that\u2019s factor two. So one is the industry is potentially big and inefficient; two is there\u2019s tools that we have easy to access it. And there has been \u2014 I think again \u2014 a general frustration on healthcare online I would say of when you go into a search engine, or you go into Web MD or Google or whatever, the general feedback it gives you is you\u2019re about to have a heart attack or you\u2019re about to die because those products are not designed specifically for that. So you as a consumer are confused because you\u2019re not feeling well so you go online. The next day you go see your doctor and he or she says you didn\u2019t go to Google did you, right? I know you\u2019re probably freaked out at this point. So the second point is the tools are there.<\/p>\n<p>Third I\u2019d say is that artificial intelligence, machine learning, which is kind of in the process of gaining a lot of momentum, has made it that we\u2019re able to start to dream that we could one day crunch sufficient data to get new insights into it. So I think you put those three factors together and say this seems like it could be pretty big, in terms of a space.<\/p>\n<p>One of the things that that whole space is missing is just good usability. And that\u2019s something that Internet entrepreneurs do very well. It\u2019s figure out that usability side of it. How do I make that experience more enjoyable or better or whatever? In fact, you see it in fintech. One of the reasons, largely, that these neobanks are winning is that their apps are much better than what you have from the incumbents. There\u2019s no other reason for it. And so I think there\u2019s this big opportunity that\u2019s out there, and it says all these factors lead you to this big, big industry. And then yes, that industry in itself is extremely large \u2014 all the way from dieting apps, you might think, all the way to healthy eating apps to longevity apps, to basic information about a particular disease, to basic general practitioner information. You could then break it down into female-specific products, male-specific products \u2014 so the breadth is very, very big.<\/p>\n<p>But I think the common core of that is we as humans are getting more information and knowledge about how we are, and that is going to drive, I think, a massive adoption of these products. It\u2019s knowledge, it\u2019s ease of use, and it\u2019s accessibility that just make it a dream come true if we can pull all these pieces together. And this is just speaking about the developed world. This gets even bigger potentially if I go to the third world countries where they don\u2019t even have access to basic healthcare information or basic nutritional information. So I would say that the addressable market in investors\u2019 jargon is just huge. Much more so than in any other industry that I know of today.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Is the fund trying to break that down into particular areas of focus within that or is the fund potentially interested in everything that falls under this digital health\/mHealth umbrella?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We are a generalist investment firm. As a generalist investment firm we find these trends and then anything within these trends is going to pique our interest. Where we have made some investments has been really in three areas so far, and we\u2019ll continue to broaden that base.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve made an investment into a company called Flo. They are the number one app in the world for women to help track their menstrual cycles. So you look at that and go can that be big, not big, I don\u2019t know. I can tell you they have 35M monthly active users, so it\u2019s massive.<\/p>\n<p>Now you might say, &#8216;Why do women need this to help them track their cycles because they\u2019ve been tracking these menstrual cycles other ways for thousands of years?&#8217; This is where, as an investor, you have to combine something like that with new behavioral patterns in people. And so if you look at the younger generation of people today they\u2019re a generation that\u2019s been growing up on notifications \u2014 the concept of being notified to do something. Or reminded to do something. And I think these apps do a lot of that as well.<\/p>\n<p>My wife, who\u2019s had two children, might say \u2014 which she did before I invested in the company \u2014 why would I ever need such an app? And I told her, &#8220;Unfortunately you\u2019re the wrong demographic\u2026 because when I speak to an 18- year-old she says, \u2018Ah, so cool! And by the way do you have an app to remind me to brush my teeth?\u2019 So notifications is what I think what makes it interesting for that younger demographic.<\/p>\n<p>And then curiously enough \u2014 this is again the magic of what technology can bring and great products can bring \u2014 Flo is a company created by two brothers. They had no particular direct experience of the need for the app. They knew the market was big. They obviously hired women who were more contextually savvy to the problem but they were able to build this fantastic product. And did a bunch of things within the product that they had taken from their previous lives and made it so that the user experience was just so much better than looking at a calendar on your phone. So today 35M women every month use this product tells you that there\u2019s something there \u2014 that the tech is coming and that people want to use it. And so that\u2019s one type of a problem, and you can think about a number of others that both males and females will have \u2014 for whom making that single user experience better could be interesting. And I could go from that to ten things that might be interesting for women and ten things that might specifically be interesting for men \u2014 you can imagine breaking that down. This is why, again, the space is so big. There are so many things that we deal with as men and women [related to health and biology].<\/p>\n<p>Now for me the question is, as a venture investor, will that sub-set be big enough?<\/p>\n<p>And that again is no different than if I was looking at any other industry. If I was in the telecommunications industry \u2014 well is voice calling big? Is messaging big enough? Is conference calling big enough? All that is around calling, but you start breaking it down and, in some cases, we\u2019re going to conclude that it\u2019s big enough or that it\u2019s not big enough. But we\u2019re going to have to go through the process of looking at these. And we\u2019re seeing these thematic things pop up all over the place right now. All over Europe and in the U.S. as well.<\/p>\n<p>It did take us a little time to say is this big enough [in the case of Flo] but obviously getting pregnant is big enough. And as a business, think about it: once you know a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle process and then she starts feeding into the system, \u2018I am pregnant; I\u2019m going to have a child,\u2019 you start having a lot of information about her life and you can feed a lot of other things to her. Because you know when she\u2019s going to have a child, you can propose advice as well around here\u2019s how the first few months go. Because, as we know, when you have your first child, you\u2019re generally a novice. You\u2019re discovering what all that means. And again you have another opportunity to re-engage with that user. So that\u2019s something that I think is interesting as a space.<\/p>\n<p>So the thematic space is going to be big \u2014 the femtech side and the male tech side. All of that\u2019s going to play a big role. One could argue always there are the specific apps that are going to be the winners; we can argue about that. But right now I guess Flo is working very well because those people haven\u2019t found such a targeted user experience in the more generic place. They feel as if they\u2019re in a community of like-minded women. They have forums, they can talk, they have articles they can read, and it\u2019s just a comfortable place for them to spend some time.<\/p>\n<p>So Flo is the first example of a very specific play that we did in healthcare about a year and a half ago. The first investment, in fact, that we made in healthcare.<\/p>\n<p>The second example is opposed to that \u2014 it\u2019s a much more general play in healthcare. It\u2019s a company called <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/kang-health\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"kang-health\">K Health <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. Now K Health looked at the world\u2026 and said what happens when I wake up at night and I have a pain and I do go to Google and I think I\u2019m going to have a heart attack\u2026. So can I build a product that would mimic, if you will, a doctor? So that I might be able to create an experience when I can have immediacy of information and immediacy of diagnostics on my phone. And then I could figure out what to do with that.<\/p>\n<p>This is an Israeli company and they now have 5 million users in the U.S. that are using the app, which is downloadable from the U.S. app story only. What they did is they spent a year and a half building the technology \u2014 the AI and the machine learning \u2014 because what they did is they bought a very large dataset from an insurance company. The company sold it to them anonymized. It was personal health records for 2.5 million people for 20, years so we had a lot of information. A lot of this stuff was in handwritten notes. It wasn\u2019t well structured. So it took them a long time to build the software to be able to understand all this information and break it down into billions of data parts that they could now manipulate. And the user experience is just like a WhatsApp chat with a robot.<\/p>\n<p>Their desire is not to do what some other companies are doing, which is \u2018answer ten questions and maybe you should talk to a doctor via Skype.\u2019 Because their view was that \u2014 at the end of the day \u2014 in every developed country there are shortages of doctors. That\u2019s true for the U.K.; it\u2019s true for the U.S. If you predict out to 2030, there\u2019s a huge hole in the number of GPs. Part of that is also totally understandable; who would want to be a GP today? I mean your job in the U.S. and the U.K. is you\u2019re essentially a sausage factory. Come in and you\u2019ve got 3 minutes with your customer. It\u2019s not a great experience for the doctor or the person who goes to the doctor.<\/p>\n<p>So K Health built this fantastic app and what they do is they diagnose you and they say based on the symptoms here\u2019s what K thinks you have, and, by the way, here\u2019s a medicine that people like you were treated with. So there\u2019s an amazing amount of information that you get as a user, and that\u2019s entirely free as a user experience. Their vision is that the diagnostic part will always be free.<\/p>\n<p>There are 5 million people in the US.. using the app who are diagnosing. There are 25 questions that you go through with the robot, \u2018K,&#8217; and she diagnoses you. We call that a virtual doctor\u2019s visit. We\u2019re doing 15,000 of those a day. Think about the scale in which we\u2019ve been able to go in a very short time. And all that\u2019s free.<\/p>\n<p>To some extent it\u2019s great for people who can\u2019t necessarily afford doctors \u2014 again, that\u2019s not typically a European problem. Because socialized medicine in Europe has made that easy. But it is a problem in the U.S.; it is a problem in Africa, Asia, India and South America. There\u2019s about 4 billion people around the world for whom speaking to a doctor is a problem.<\/p>\n<p>K Health\u2019s view is they\u2019re bringing healthcare free to the world. And then ultimately how they make money will be things like if you want to speak to a doctor because you need a prescription for drugs. The doctor has access to K\u2019s diagnostic and either agrees or disagrees with it and gives you a prescription to do that. And what we\u2019re seeing is an interesting relationship which is where we wanted it to be. Of those 15,000 free doctor visits, less than one percent of those turn into I want to speak to a human and hence pay $15 (that\u2019s the price they\u2019re charging in the U.S. to actually converse with a human). In the U.S., by the way, about a quarter of the population \u2014 75 million people \u2014 don\u2019t have complementary insurance. That when they go to the doctor it\u2019s $150. Isn\u2019t that a crazy thing? You can\u2019t afford complementary insurance but you could pay the highest price to go see a doctor. Such madness.<\/p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s a whole element of it&#8217;s simple, and it\u2019s convenient. You\u2019re sitting at home thinking, &#8220;Okay, I\u2019m not feeling so well&#8221; and you&#8217;ve got to call a doctor, get an appointment, drive however long it takes, and wait in line with other sick people. So what we\u2019re finding is people are discovering new ways of accessing information\u2026. Human doctors also don\u2019t have time to give empathy in an ever stretched socialized medicine country [such as in Spain]. So what we\u2019re seeing also is a very quick change in user behavior. Two and a half years ago [when K Health started], many people would say I don\u2019t know about that. Now they\u2019re saying convenience \u2014 at least in Europe \u2014 is why that\u2019s interesting. In the U.S. it\u2019s price.<\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s the second example; much more general company but one which has the ability to come and answer a very basic need: \u2018I\u2019m not feeling well.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>We have 5M users which means we have data on 5M people. On average, a GP in his life will see about 50,000 patients. If you think about just the difference \u2014 if you come to K, K has seen 5M people, your GP Max has seen 50k. So, statistically, the app is likely to be better. We know today, through benchmarks and all sorts of other stuff, is that the app is more accurate than humans.<\/p>\n<p>So you look at where that\u2019s heading in general medicine we\u2019ve for a long time created this myth that doctors spent eight years learning a lot of information and as a result they\u2019re really brainy people. They are brainy people but I believe that that learning process is going to be done faster and better through a machine. That\u2019s our bet.<\/p>\n<p>The third example of an investment that we\u2019ve made in the health space is a company called <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/happify\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"happify\">Happify <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>. They\u2019re a company that had developed like a gamification of online treatment if you have certain sicknesses. So, for example, if you\u2019re a little depressive you can use their app and the gamification process and they will help you feel healthier. So so far you\u2019re probably scatching your head saying \u2018I don\u2019t know about that\u2026\u201d But that was how they started and then they realized that hang on you can either do that or you can take medicine; you can pop a pill. In fact what many doctors suggest for people who have anxiety or depression.<\/p>\n<p>So then they started engaging with the drugs companies and they realized that these drug companies have a problem which is the patent expiry of their medication. And when patents expire you lose a lot of money. And so what\u2019s very typical in the pharma industry is if you\u2019re able to modify a medicine you can typically either extend or have a new patent. So Happify, what they\u2019ve done with the pharma companies now, is said instead of modifying the medicine and adding something else to it \u2014 another molecule for instance \u2014 could we associate treatments which is medicine plus online software? Like a digital experience. And that has now been dubbed Digital Therapeutics \u2014 DTx \u2014 is the common term being used for them. And this company Happify is one of the first in the world to do that. They signed a very large deal with a company called Sanofi \u2014 one of the big drug makers. And that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to roll out. When doctors say to their patients I\u2019m diagnosing you with anxiety or depression. Sanofi has a particular medication and they\u2019re going to bundle it now with an online experience \u2014 and in all the tests that they\u2019ve done, actually, when you combine the two, the patient is better off at the end of this treatment. So it\u2019s just another example of why this whole space is so large. We never thought we\u2019d be in any business with a pharma business because we\u2019re tech investors. But here all of a sudden the ability to marry tech with medication creates a better end user experience for the patient. And that\u2019s very powerful in itself.<\/p>\n<p>So those are just three areas where we have actually put money in the health space but there are a number of areas that one looks at \u2014 either general or more specific.<\/p>\n<p>Yeah it is big. And I think for us at least the more general it stays and it\u2019s seen the more open minded we\u2019re going to be. Because one thing you have to be as an investor, at least early stage like ours, completely open minded. And you can\u2019t bias your process by your own experience. It has to stay very broad.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also why I think clinician led companies and investors are not good \u2014 because they come with their own baggage. I think in this case, just like in any other industry, you have to say I\u2019m not going to be polluted by the past and for me to change the experience going forward in any given area I have to fundamentally be ready to reinvent it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You could propose a <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/28\/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-to-stand-trial-in-2020\/\">Theranos<\/a> example as a counterpoint to that \u2014 but do you think investors in the health space have got over any fallout from that high profile failure at this point?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>With that company one could argue who\u2019s fault it really was. Clearly the founder lied and did all sorts of stuff but her investors let her do it. So to some extent the checks and balances just weren\u2019t in place. I\u2019m only saying that because I don\u2019t think that should be the example by which we judge everything else. That\u2019s just a case of a fraudster and dumb investors. That\u2019s going to continue to exist in the future forever and who knows we might come across some of those but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the benchmark by which one should be judging if healthcare is a good or viable investment. Again I look at Flo, 35M active users. I look at K Health, 5M users in the US who are now beginning to use doctors, order medicine through the platform. I think the simplicity, the ease of use, for me make it that it\u2019s undeniable that this industry\u2019s going to be completely shaken up through this tech. And we need it because at least in the Western world are health systems are so stretched they\u2019re going to break.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Europe vs the US is interesting \u2014 because of the existence of public healthcare vs a lack of public healthcare. What difference does that make to the startup opportunities in health in Europe vs the US? Perhaps in Europe things have to be more supplementary to public healthcare systems but perhaps ultimately there isn\u2019t that much difference if healthcare opportunities are increasingly being broken out and people are being encouraged to be more proactive about looking after their own health needs?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yeah. Take K Health \u2014 where you look at it and say from a use example it\u2019s clear that everywhere in the world, including US and Europe, people are going to recognize the simple ease of use and the convenience of it. If I had to spend money to then maybe make money then I would say maybe the US is slightly better because there\u2019s 75M people who can\u2019t afford a doctor and I might be able to sell them something more whereas in Europe I might not. I think it becomes a commercial question more than anything else. Certainly in the UK the NHS [National Health Service] is trying to do a lot of things. It is not a great user experience when you go to the doctor there. But at the end of the day I don\u2019t think the difference between Europe-US makes much of a difference. I think this idea that what these apps want to tend towards \u2014 which is healthcare for everybody at a super cheap or free price-point \u2014 I think we have an advantage in Europe of thinking of it that way because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve had all our lives. So to some extent what I want to create online is socialized medicine for the world \u2014 through K Health. And I learnt that because I live here [in Europe].<\/p>\n<p>Somebody in the US \u2014 not the 75M because they have nothing \u2014 but all the others, maybe they don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem because they don\u2019t recognize it. Our view with K Health is the opportunity to make socialized medicine a global phenomenon and hoping that in 95% of the cases access to the app is all you need. And in 5% of the cases you\u2019re going to go the specialists that need to see you \u2014 and then maybe there\u2019s enough money to go around for everybody.<\/p>\n<p>And of course, as an investor, we\u2019re interested in global companies. Again you see the theme: Flo, K Health, Happify, all those have a potential global footprint right off the bat.<\/p>\n<p>I think with healthcare there are going to be play that could be national specific and maybe still going to be decent investments. You see in that in financial services. The neo banks are very country specific \u2014 whenever they try to get out of their country, like N26, they realize that life isn\u2019t so easy when you go somewhere else. But healthcare I think we have an easier path to going global because there is such a pent up demand and a need for you to just feel good about yourself\u2026 Most of the people who go through [the K Health diagnostic] process just want peace of mind. If 95% of the 15k people who go through that process right now just go, &#8220;Phew, I feel okay&#8221; then we\u2019ve accomplished something quite significant. And imagine if it\u2019s not 15,000 it\u2019s about 150,000 a day, which seems to be quite an easy goal. So healthcare allows us to dream that TAM \u2014 in investor terms, target addressable market \u2014 is big. I can realistically think with any one of the three companies that I\u2019ve mentioned to you that we could have hundreds of millions of users around the world. Because there\u2019s the need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are different regulatory regimes across markets, there are different cultural contexts around the world \u2014 do you see this as a winner takes all scenario for health platforms?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>No. Not at all. I think ultimately it\u2019s the user \u2014 in terms of his or her experience in using an app \u2014 that\u2019s going to matter. Flo is not the only menstrual cycle app in the world; it just happens to be by far the biggest. But there\u2019s others. So that\u2019s the perfect example. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be one winner takes it all.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There\u2019s also (UK startup) <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/02\/babylon-health-confirms-550m-raise-to-expand-its-ai-based-health-services-to-the-us-and-asia\/\">Babylon Health<\/a> which sounds quite similar to K Health\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Babylon does something different. They\u2019re essentially a symptom checker designed to push you to have a Skype call with a human doctor\u2026. It answers a bunch of questions, it\u2019ll say, &#8220;Well, we think you have this, let\u2019s connect you to a real doctor.&#8221; We did not want to invest in a company that ever did that because the real problem is there just aren\u2019t enough doctors and then frankly you and I are not going to want to talk to a doctor from Angola. Because what\u2019s going to happen is there aren\u2019t enough doctors in the Western countries and the solution for those type of companies \u2014 Babylon is one, there\u2019s others doing similar things \u2014 but if you become what we call lead generation just for doctors where you get a commission for bringing people to speak to a doctor you\u2019re just displacing the problem from in your neighborhood to, broadly speaking, where are the humans? And I think as I said humans, they have their fallacies. If you really want to scale things big and globally you have to let software do it.<\/p>\n<p>No it\u2019s not a winner takes all \u2014 for sure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So the vision is that this stuff starts as a supplement to existing healthcare systems and gradually scales?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Correct. I\u2019ll give you an example in the U.S. with K Health. They have a deal with the second largest insurance company called Anthem. Their go-to-market brand is called Blue Cross, Blue Shield. It\u2019s the second largest one in America\u2026 so why is this insurance company interested? Because they know that<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>There\u2019s not enough doctors.<\/li>\n<li>That the health system in the U.S. is under stress<\/li>\n<li>If they could reduce the amount of doctor\u2019s visits by promoting an app like K, that\u2019s financially beneficial to them.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So they\u2019re going to be proposing it, in various forms, to all their customers by saying, &#8220;Before you go see a doctor, why don\u2019t you try K?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In this particular case with K there\u2019s revenue opportunities from the insurance companies and also directly from the consumer, which makes it also interesting.<\/p>\n<p>You did say different regions, different countries have different systems \u2014 yes absolutely and there\u2019s no question that going international requires work. However, having said that, I would say a European, an Indonesian and a Brazilian are largely similar. There\u2019s sometimes this fallacy that Asians, for instance, are so different from us as Western Europeans. And the truth is not really \u2014 when you look at it down into the DNA and the functions of the body and stuff like that. Which you do have to do, though. If we were to take K to Indonesia, for example, you do have to make sure that your AI engine has enough data to be able to diagnose some local stuff.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ll give you an example. When we launched K in the U.S. and we started off with New York, one of things you have to be able to diagnose is called Lyme disease which is what you get from a tick that bites you. Very, very prevalent in the Greater New York area. Not so much anywhere else in the States. But in New York, if you don\u2019t have it it looks like a cold and then you get very sick. That\u2019s very much a regional thing that you have to have. And so if we were to go to Indonesia we\u2019d have to have thing like Malaria and Dengue. But all that is not so difficult. But yes, there\u2019s some customization.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are also certain conditions that can be more common for certain ethnicities. There are also differences in how women experience medical conditions vs men. So there can be a lot of issues around how localized health data is\u2026<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I would say that that is a very small problem that is a must to be addressed, but it\u2019s a much smaller problem than you think it is. Much smaller. For instance, in the male to female thing \u2014 of course medical sometimes plays differently \u2014 but when you have a database of 5 million of which 3 million are women, and 2 million are men, you already have that data embedded. It is true that medications work better with certain races also. But again very tiny, very small examples of those. Most doctors know it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>At the big scale that may look very small but to an individual patient if a system is not going to pick up on their condition or prescribe them the right medicine that\u2019s obviously catastrophic from their point of view&#8230;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which is why, in the healthcare space, when you\u2019re using AI and data-driven tools to do diagnosis there\u2019s a lot of risk \u2014 and that\u2019s part of the consideration for everyone playing in this space. So then the question is how do you break down that risk, how do you make that as small as possible and how do you communicate it to the users \u2014 if the proposition is free healthcare with some risk vs. not being able to afford going to the doctor at all?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I appreciate that, as a journalist, you\u2019re trying to say this is a massive risk. I can tell you that as somebody who\u2019s involved in these businesses it is a business risk we have to take into consideration but it is, by far, not insurmountable. We clearly have a responsibility as businesses to say: if I\u2019m going to go to South East Asia, I need to be sure that I cover all the \u2018weird\u2019 things that we would not have in our database somewhere else. So I need to do that. How I go about doing that, obviously, is the secret sauce of each company. But you simply cannot launch your product in that region if you don\u2019t solve \u2014 in this case Malaria and Dengue disease. It doesn\u2019t make sense [for a general health app]. You\u2019d have too many flaws and people will stop using you.<\/p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think that\u2019s so much the case with Flo, for instance\u2026 But all these entrepreneurs who are designing these companies are fully aware that it isn\u2019t a cookie-cutter, one-size fits all \u2014 but it is close to that. When you look at the exceptions. We\u2019re not talking about I have to redo my database because 30% or 20% \u2014 it\u2019s much, much smaller than that.<\/p>\n<p>And, by the way, at the end of the day, the market will be the judge. In our case, when you go from an Israeli company into the U.S. and you have partners like Blue Cross, Blue Shield, they\u2019ve tested the crap out of your product. And then you\u2019re going to say well I\u2019m going to do this now in Indonesia \u2014 well you get partners locally who\u2019re going to help you do that.<\/p>\n<p>One of the drawbacks about healthcare is, I would say, making sure that your product works in all these countries. And doesn\u2019t have holes in the diagnostic side of it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Which seems in many cases to boil down to getting the data. And that can be a big challenge. As you mentioned with K Health, there was also the need to structure the data as well \u2014 but fundamentally it\u2019s taken Israeli population data and is using it in the U.S. You would say that model is going to scale? There are some counter examples, such as Google-owned DeepMind, which has big designs on using AI for healthcare diagnostics and has put a lot of effort into getting access to population-level health data from the NHS in the U.K., when \u2014 at the same time \u2014 Google has acquired a database of health records from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. So there does seem to be a lot of effort going into trying to get very localized data but it\u2019s challenging. Google perhaps has a head start because it\u2019s Google. So the question then is how do startups get the data they need to address these kinds of opportunities?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If we\u2019re just looking at K Health then obviously it\u2019s a big challenge because you do have to get data in a way. But I would say again your example as well you have a U.S. database and does it match with a UK database. Again it largely does.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In that case the example is quite specific because the dataset Google has from the department of Veterans Affairs <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/07\/31\/deepmind-touts-predictive-healthcare-ai-breakthrough-trained-on-heavily-skewed-data\/\">skews heavily male (93.6%)<\/a>. So they really do have almost no female data.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But that\u2019s a bad dataset. That\u2019s not anything else but a bad dataset.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It\u2019s instructive that they\u2019re still using it, though. Maybe that illustrates the challenge of getting access to population-level healthcare data for AI model making.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Maybe it does. But I don\u2019t think this is one of those insurmountable things. Again, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve bought a database that had data on 2.5 million patients, data over 20 years. I think that dataset equates extremely well. We\u2019ve now seen it in U.S. markets for over a year. We\u2019ve had nothing but positive feedback. We beat human doctors every time in tests. And so you look at it and you say they\u2019re just business problems that we have to solve. But what we\u2019re seeing is the consumer market is saying holy shit this is just such a better experience than I\u2019ve ever had before.<\/p>\n<p>So the human body \u2014 again \u2014 is not that complex. Most of the things that we catch are not that complex. And by the way we\u2019ve grown our database \u2014 from the 2.5M that we bought we now have 5M. So we now have 2.5M Americans mixing into that database. And the way they diagnose you is they say based on your age, your size, you don\u2019t smoke and so on \u2014 perhaps they say they have 300,000 people in their database like you and they\u2019re benchmarking my symptoms against those people. So I think the smart companies are going to do these things very smartly. But you have to know what you\u2019re using as a user as well\u2026 If you\u2019re using that vs just a basic symptom checker \u2014 that I don\u2019t think is a particularly great new user experience. But some companies are going to be successful doing that. At the end the great dream is how do you bring all this together and how do you give the consumer a fundamentally better choice and better information. That\u2019s K Health.<\/p>\n<p>Why couldn\u2019t Google do the same thing? I don\u2019t know. They just don\u2019t think about it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>That\u2019s a really interesting question \u2014 because Google is making big moves in health. They\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/11\/14\/google-gobbling-deepminds-health-app-might-be-the-trust-shock-we-need\/\">consolidating all their projects<\/a> under one Google Health unit. Amazon is also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/06\/28\/amazon-buys-pillpack-an-online-pharmacy-that-was-rumored-to-be-talking-to-walmart\/\">increasingly interested<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/10\/24\/alexa-where-are-the-legal-limits-on-what-amazon-can-do-with-my-health-data\/\">in the space<\/a>. What do you make of this big tech interest? Is that a threat or an opportunity for health startups?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Well if you think of it as an investor they\u2019re all obviously buyers of the companies you\u2019re going to build. So that\u2019s a long term opportunity to sell your business. On the shorter term, does it make sense to invest in companies if all of a sudden the mammoth big players are there? By the way, that has been true for many, many other sectors as well. When I first invested in Skype in the early days people would say the telecom guys are going to crush you. Well they didn\u2019t. But all of a sudden telecom, communication became the current that the Internet guys wanted \u2014 that\u2019s why eBay ultimately bought us and why they all had their own messenger.<\/p>\n<p>What the future\u2019s made of we don\u2019t know, but what we do know is that consumers want just the best experience and sometimes the best experience comes from people who are very innovative and very hungry as opposed to people who are working in very large companies. Venture capitalists are always investing in companies that somehow are competing one way or another with Amazon, Facebook, Google and all the big guys. It\u2019s just that when you focus your energy on one thing you tend to do it better than if you don\u2019t. And I\u2019m not suggesting that those companies are not investing a lot of money. They are. And that\u2019s because they realize that one of the currencies of the future is the ability to provide healthcare information, treatment and things like that.<\/p>\n<p>You look at a large retail store like Wal-mart in America. Wal-mart serves largely a population that makes $50k or less. The lower income category in North America. But what are they doing to make you more loyal to them? They\u2019re now starting to build into every Wal-mart doctor\u2019s offices. Why would they do that? Is it because they actually know that if you make $50k or less there\u2019s a high chance you don\u2019t have an insurance and there\u2019s a high chance that you can\u2019t afford to go see a doctor. So they\u2019re going to use that to say, &#8220;Hey, if you shop with us, instead of paying $150 for a doctor, it\u2019ll be cheaper.&#8221; And we\u2019re beginning to see so many examples like this \u2014 where all these companies are saying actually healthcare is the biggest and most important thing that somebody thinks about every day. And if we want to make them loyal to our brand we need to offer something that\u2019s in the healthcare space. So the conclusion of why we\u2019re so excited it we\u2019re seeing it happen in real life.<\/p>\n<p>Wal-mart does that \u2014 so when Amazon starts buying an online pharmacy I get why they\u2019re doing that. They want to connect with you on an emotional level which is when you\u2019re not feeling well.<\/p>\n<p>So no, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re particularly worried about them. You have to respect they\u2019re large companies, they have a lot of money and things like that. But that\u2019s always been the case. We think that some of these will likely be bought by those players, some of those will likely build their own businesses. At the end of the day it\u2019s who\u2019s going to get that user experience right.<\/p>\n<p>Google of course would like us all to believe that because they\u2019re the search engine of the world they have the first rights to become the health search engine of the world. I tend to think that\u2019s not true. Actually if you look at the history of Google they were the search engine of the world until they forgot about Amazon. And nowadays if you want to buy anything physical where do you search first? You don\u2019t search on Google anymore \u2014 you search on Amazon.<\/p>\n<p>But the space is big and there\u2019s a lot of great entrepreneurs and Europe has a lot to offer I think in terms of taking our history of socialized medicine and saying how can tech power that to make it a better experience?<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what should entrepreneurs that are just thinking about this space \u2014 what should they be focusing on in terms of things to fix?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Right now the hottest are the three that I mentioned \u2014 because those are the ones that we\u2019ve put money into and we\u2019ve put money in because we think those are the hottest areas. I just think that anything where you feel deep conviction about or you\u2019ve had some basic experience with the issue and the problem.<\/p>\n<p>I simply do not think that clinicians can make this change \u2014 in any sector. If you look at those companies I mentioned none of the founders are clinicians in any way shape or form. And that\u2019s why they\u2019re successful. Now I\u2019m not suggesting that you don\u2019t have to have doctors on your staff. For sure. At K Health, we have 30 doctors\u2026. What we\u2019re trying to do is change the experience. So the founder, for instance. was a founder of a company called Vroom that buys and sells cars online in the States. When he started he didn\u2019t know a whole lot about healthcare but he said to himself what I know is I don\u2019t like the user experience. It\u2019s a horrible user experience. I don\u2019t like going to the doctor. I can change that.<\/p>\n<p>So I would say if you\u2019re heading into that space your first pre-occupation is how am I going to change the current user experience in a way that\u2019s meaningful. Because that\u2019s the only thing that people care about.<\/p>\n<p>How is possible that two guys could come up with Flo? They were just good product people.<\/p>\n<p>For me, that\u2019s the driving factor \u2014 if you\u2019re going to go into this, go into it saying you\u2019re there to break an experience and make it just a way better place to be.<\/p>\n<p><strong>On the size of the opportunity I have seen some suggestions that health is overheated in investment terms. But perhaps that\u2019s more true in the U.S. than Europe?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any time an investor community gets hold of a theme and makes it the theme of the month or the year \u2014 like fintech was for ten years \u2014 I think it becomes overfunded because everybody ploughs into that. I could say yes to that statement sure. Lot of players, lot of actors. Money\u2019s pouring in because people believe that the outcome could be big. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s overheated. I think that we\u2019ve only scratched the surface by doing certain things.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the companies in the healthcare space that are either thinking of going public or are going public are companies that are pretty basic companies around connecting you with doctors online, etc. So I think that the innovation is really, really coming. As AI becomes real and we\u2019re able to manage the data in an effective way\u2026 But again you\u2019ve got to get the user experience right.<\/p>\n<p>Flo in my experience \u2014 why it\u2019s better than anything else \u2014 one is it\u2019s just a great user experience. And then they have a forum on their app, and the forum is anonymized. And this is curious right. I think they anonymized it without knowing what it would do. And what it did was it allowed women to talk about stuff that perhaps they were not comfortable talking about stuff if people knew who they were. Number one issue? Abortion.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a stigma out there around abortion and so by anonymizing the chat forum all of a sudden it created this opportunity for people to just exchange an experience. So that\u2019s why I say the user experience for me is just at the core of that revolution that\u2019s coming.<\/p>\n<p>Why should it be such a horrific experience to be able to talk about that subject? Why should women be put in that position? So that\u2019s why I think user experience is going to be so key to that.<\/p>\n<p>So that\u2019s why we\u2019re excited. And of course the gambit is large. You think about the examples I gave \u2014 you can think of dietary examples, men\u2019s health examples. When men turn 50 things start happening. Little things. But there\u2019s at least 15 of those things that are 100% predictable\u2026 I just turned 50 and given there\u2019s so much disinformation online I don\u2019t know what\u2019s true. So I think again there\u2019s a fantastic opportunity for somebody to build companies around that theme \u2014 again, probably male and female separate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Menopause would be another obvious one.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Exactly\u2026 You don\u2019t know who you can talk to in many cases. So that\u2019s another opportunity. And wow there are so many things out there. And when I go online today I\u2018m generally not sure if I can believe what I read unless it\u2019s from a source that I can trust.<\/p>\n<p>For 50 year old men erectile dysfunction is another taboo \u2014 a bit like the abortion taboo is for women. Men don\u2019t even talk to their male friends about it\u2026 So if there was a place where you could go and learn about it I think there\u2019s a big opportunity. I don\u2019t think erectile dysfunction is a business, but I think how men age is one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So it\u2019s opportunities for communities around particular health\/well-being issues.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Exactly. Because we\u2019re looking for truths when we\u2019re going through that experience ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>The addressable market is massive. There\u2019s men turning 50 every year and they\u2019re probably all pretty interested to find out what are the ten or 15 things that could go wrong for them. There\u2019s a lot of opportunities. It\u2019s so broad. The challenge is you have to think about building it for people who are 50. You\u2019re not building it for an 18-year-old. So the user experience again has to be somewhat different probably. And the healthcare goes all the way to the seniors. What are you looking for when you\u2019re 75? So you see it treats anywhere from certainly from 18 all the way up across a broad-based spectrum of things. So it\u2019s one of our major themes for the next five to ten years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>And so the idea of it being overheated in investment terms is a bit too abstract because there are specific areas that are very underinvested \u2014 like femtech. So it\u2019s a case of spotting the particular bits of the healthcare opportunity that need more attention.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Yes. You\u2019ve described it perfectly. In our more simpleton terms, we look at it and say if I look at the previous hot industry \u2014 fintech \u2014 you would end up with companies doing credit cards, companies doing bank accounts, companies doing lending, companies doing recovery \u2014 so many pieces of the value chain. In this case the value chain is humans.<\/p>\n<p>We are even more complex than financial services have ever been, so I think the opportunities are even broader to break it down and build businesses that are going to satisfy certain sexes, maybe certain demographics, certain ages and all these kind of things that are out there. We are just so different.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mangrove Capital Partners&#8217; co-founder and CEO Mark Tluszcz is brimming with enthusiasm for what\u2019s coming down the pipe from health tech startups.

href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/martin_casado\">Martin Casado<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/a16z.com\/author\/matt-bornstein\/\">Matt Bornstein<\/a> published an <a href=\"https:\/\/a16z.com\/2020\/02\/16\/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software\/\">interesting piece<\/a> digging into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) startups, and, more specifically, how those companies perform as businesses. Core to the argument presented is that while founders and investors are wagering &#8220;that AI businesses will resemble traditional software companies,&#8221; the well-known venture firm is &#8220;not so sure.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Given that TechCrunch cares a lot about startup business fundamentals, the notion that one <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/02\/19\/announcing-the-final-agenda-for-robotics-ai-march-3-at-uc-berkeley\/\">oft-discussed<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2020\/01\/14\/ai-startups-raised-18-5-billion-in-2019-setting-new-funding-record\/\">and well-funded<\/a> category of venture-backed startup might sport materially less attractive economics than we expected captured our attention.<\/p>\n<p>The Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) perspective is straightforward, arguing that AI-focused companies have lesser gross margins than software companies due to cloud compute and human-input costs, endure issues stemming from &#8220;edge-cases&#8221; and enjoy less product differentiation from competing companies when compared to software concerns. Today, we&#8217;re drilling into the gross margin point, as it&#8217;s something inherently numerical that we can get other, informed market participants to weigh in on.<\/p>\n<p>If a16z is correct about AI startups having slimmer gross margins than SaaS companies, they should \u2014 all other things held equal \u2014 be worth less per dollar of revenue generated; or in simpler terms, they should trade at a revenue multiple <em>discount<\/em> to SaaS companies, leaving the latter category of technology company still atop the valuation hierarchy.<\/p>\n<p>This matters, given the amount of capital that AI-focused startups have raised.<\/p>\n<p>Is a16z correct about AI gross margins? I wanted to find out. So this week I spoke to a number of investors from firms that have made AI-focused bets to get a handle on their views. Read the full a16z piece, mind. It&#8217;s interesting and worth your time.<\/p>\n<p>Today we&#8217;re hearing from <a href=\"https:\/\/trueventures.com\/team\/rohit-sharma\/\">Rohit Sharma of True Ventures<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.scalevp.com\/team\/jeremy-kaufmann\">Jeremy Kaufmann of Scale Venture Partners<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/nick-washburn-32216226\/\">Nick Washburn of Intel Capital<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atomico.com\/team\/ben-blume\/\">Ben Blume of Atomico<\/a>. We&#8217;ll start with a digest of their responses to our questions, with their unedited notes at the end.<\/p>\n<h2>AI economics and optimism<\/h2>\n<p>We asked our group of venture investors\u00a0(selected with the help of research from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/armantabatabai?lang=en\">TechCrunch&#8217;s Arman Tabatabai<\/a>) three questions.

Companies like <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/crunchbase.com\/organization\/rocket-lab\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"rocket-lab\">Rocket Lab <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> (in which her company has a stake) will increase their volume and cadence and benefit from having a proven track record, taking up a lot of the growth in launch vehicle demand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s room for any more rockets in the industry,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Hatch is looking to payload variety and innovation as the next big thing in space tech. Satellites are becoming increasingly commoditized, and companies like Rocket Lab are looking to take this further by providing a satellite platform (Proton) as part of its launch offering.
